        # Glenmorangie 1987 - Margaux Cask Finish Review

Glenmorangie, a brand revered for its creativity and craftsmanship in the world of single malt Scotch, has once again captivated the senses with the Glenmorangie 1987 Margaux Cask Finish. This particular expression is one that whispers luxury and complexity, carrying a hefty price tag of £1699. With an ABV of 40%, it sits comfortably at the lower end of the strength spectrum, promising a gentle sip that doesn't skimp on depth.

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the packaging of the Glenmorangie 1987 is nothing short of elegant—a fitting prelude to the liquid gold that rests within. The whisky itself greets the eye with a rich, amber hue, a visual testament to its time spent in the finest of wine casks.

## Flavour Profile

The initial nose offers a bouquet of aromas that are both intricate and inviting, with hints of dark berries and a subtle floral undertone, likely a nod to its unique finishing in Margaux wine casks from the esteemed Bordeaux region. On the palate, this whisky unfolds gracefully, revealing layers of flavor. There's a harmonious blend of ripe fruits, perhaps cherries and plums, intertwined with a delicate spiciness and the unmistakable presence of oak. The finish is long and satisfying, with a lingering sweetness and a touch of tannic dryness, reminiscent of the wine that once graced the casks.

## Value for Money

Let's talk turkey—£1699 is no small investment for a bottle of whisky. But is it good value for money? For the casual drinker, it's a tough sell. However, for the collector or the enthusiast with a penchant for rare finds, the Glenmorangie 1987 Margaux Cask Finish could be a worthy addition. It's a limited edition release, and its unique cask finish sets it apart from more conventional offerings.

## Comparable Whiskies

Those who appreciate the Glenmorangie 1987 might also enjoy other wine-finished whiskies, such as the Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or, which is finished in Sauternes casks, or even venture into the realm of port finishes with the GlenDronach Port Wood. Both offer that intriguing interplay between whisky and wine, though at a more accessible price point.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

Glenmorangie has a storied history dating back to 1843 and has long been known for its pursuit of perfection and innovation in whisky-making. The Margaux Cask Finish is a shining example of their dedication to pushing the boundaries of flavor and maturation.

## Final Thoughts

The Glenmorangie 1987 - Margaux Cask Finish is a whisky that commands attention. Its intricate flavors, the prestige of its cask finish, and its exclusivity all contribute to its allure. However, it's important to consider whether the experience aligns with the expense for you personally.

### Rating: 4/5

A sublime whisky for those who appreciate the finer intricacies of maturation and the blend of Scotch whisky with the essence of French winemaking. However, its price point may be prohibitive for many, making it a special occasion sipper rather than an everyday dram.

In conclusion, the Glenmorangie 1987 - Margaux Cask Finish is a remarkable expression that showcases the art of whisky-making. It's a bottle that tells a story—one of heritage, craftsmanship, and a bold willingness to experiment.
