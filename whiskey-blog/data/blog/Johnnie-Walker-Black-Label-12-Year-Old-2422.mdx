        # Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Johnnie Walker  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £27.65

Johnnie Walker Black Label is a true stalwart in the world of blended Scotch whiskies, and its 12 Year Old expression is a testament to the blender's craft. At a modest price point of just under £30, this bottle often stands as the entry point for many into the premium whisky category.

## First Impressions

The iconic square bottle with its slanted label is immediately recognizable, exuding a classic charm that's both reassuring and inviting. Upon opening, you're greeted with a blend of rich aromas: hints of vanilla, a touch of smoke, and a whisper of dried fruit.

## The Palate's Journey

Taking a sip, the smoothness of the blend is what strikes you first. The 40% ABV offers a gentle warmth without any harshness. The flavor profile is well-rounded, with a harmonious balance of sweet and smoky notes. There's a dance of toffee and dark chocolate, with a subtle smokiness that doesn't overpower but rather complements the sweeter elements. The finish is moderately long, with a pleasing aftertaste of peat and a final flourish of spice.

## Value for Money?

When it comes to value, Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 Year Old is often praised for its affordability paired with quality. It's a versatile whisky, equally at home in a neat pour as it is in a cocktail. For those just beginning their whisky journey or seasoned drinkers looking for a reliable staple, it's hard to argue against the value this bottle provides.

## Comparisons and Brand Legacy

Within its price bracket, you might compare it to the likes of Chivas Regal 12 or perhaps the Dewar's 12 Year Old, both of which offer their own take on the aged blended Scotch experience. Johnnie Walker, however, benefits from a long-standing reputation and a global presence that few can match. The brand's commitment to consistency is evident with every sip of the Black Label.

Johnnie Walker has been synonymous with blended Scotch whisky for decades. Their range, which includes the Red Label, Green Label, and the prestigious Blue Label, showcases their blending expertise. The Black Label holds its ground as a solid middle-ground offering that reflects the brand's heritage and craftsmanship.

## Final Thoughts and Rating

**Rating:** 4/5

In summary, Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 Year Old is a well-crafted, accessible whisky that offers good value for its price. It's a reliable choice for both newcomers and whisky aficionados seeking a dependable dram. While it may not be the most complex or unique whisky on the shelf, it delivers a consistent and enjoyable experience that's hard to fault. Its broad appeal and quality earn it a strong 4 out of 5. Whether you're toasting a special occasion or simply winding down after a long day, Black Label is a companion you can count on.
