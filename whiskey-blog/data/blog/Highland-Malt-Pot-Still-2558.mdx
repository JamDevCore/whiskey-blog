        # Highland Malt Pot Still Review

**ABV:** 40%
**Price:** Â£89.99

Stepping into the world of Highland Malt Pot Still whiskey is like being welcomed into a cozy, wood-paneled room with a roaring fireplace. This whiskey is a classic representation of Highland distilleries' commitment to craftsmanship and tradition.

### First Impressions
The bottle itself is unassuming yet elegant, suggesting that what's inside speaks for itself without the need for flashy packaging. Upon uncorking the bottle, there's a subtle invitation of warm, malty aromas that hint at the experience to come.

### Flavor Profile
As you take the first sip, the 40% ABV delivers a gentle warmth that is neither overpowering nor timid. The initial notes are a dance of honey and ripe fruit, with a whisper of vanilla that seems to play hide and seek on the palate. The mid-taste brings a more robust character, with a nutty complexity and a touch of spice that makes you think of autumn evenings.

The finish is where Highland Malt Pot Still truly shines. It's smooth, with a lingering sweetness that has a satisfying depth, like the last note of a favorite song that resonates long after it's played.

### Value for Money
At $89.99, this whiskey sits at a price point that's approachable for an enthusiast looking to explore the Highland style without breaking the bank. It's not the cheapest on the shelf, but the quality you're getting is well worth the investment. For the same price, you might consider other options like Glenmorangie Original or Dalmore 12 Year Old, which offer different but comparable experiences.

### Brand and Distillery
Highland Malt is a brand that doesn't always make headlines, but among those in the know, it's a respected name that consistently delivers quality. They take pride in their pot still production method, which is a traditional approach that's becoming rarer in the industry, ensuring a unique profile that sets them apart from their column-distilled counterparts.

### Overall Experience
This is a whiskey that doesn't shout for attention but rather invites you in for a meaningful conversation. It's versatile enough to be enjoyed on its own or as a distinguished component in a cocktail that calls for a premium touch.

### Rating: 4/5

**Summary:** Highland Malt Pot Still is a solid and enjoyable expression of Highland whiskey. With its inviting aroma, balanced flavor profile, and smooth finish, it's a bottle that offers good value for its price. It might not revolutionize your whiskey experience, but it will undoubtedly be a satisfying addition to your collection. Whether you're a seasoned whiskey lover or just dipping your toes in, this is a dram that won't disappoint.
