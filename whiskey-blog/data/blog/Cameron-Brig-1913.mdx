        # Cameron Brig Single Grain Whisky Review

**Distillery:** Cameron Bridge  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £23.33 (price may vary based on location and retailer)

Cameron Brig, produced by the storied Cameron Bridge distillery, is a single grain whisky that promises a smooth and approachable experience without breaking the bank. Let's dive into what this dram has to offer.

### First Impressions:

Upon first glance, Cameron Brig's presentation is straightforward and unassuming. The bottle design doesn't scream luxury, but that's not what this whisky is about. It's an everyday sipper, and the packaging reflects that no-nonsense approach.

### Flavour Profile:

Cameron Brig is a gentle introduction to the world of whisky. On the nose, it offers sweet notes reminiscent of toffee and vanilla with a hint of light fruitiness, perhaps a whisper of pear or apple. The palate is consistent with the nose, delivering a smooth sweetness that's easy to enjoy. You might also detect a touch of oak and a mild spice that adds a little complexity, but overall, it's a simple affair.

The finish is short and sweet, leaving a pleasant but fleeting warmth. It's the kind of whisky that doesn't demand your full attention, making it a good option for casual sipping or even as a mixer in a cocktail.

### Value for Money:

Priced at just over £23, Cameron Brig is definitely in the budget-friendly category. For those new to whisky or looking for an everyday dram that doesn't ask much of the wallet or the palate, it offers fair value. It won't compete with the depth and complexity of higher-end single malts, but it's not trying to.

### Comparable Whiskies:

In the realm of single grain whiskies, you might compare Cameron Brig to the likes of Haig Club or perhaps the Loch Lomond Single Grain. Both offer a similarly light and sweet profile, though they may come with a slightly higher price tag.

### The Brand:

Cameron Bridge distillery, the powerhouse behind this whisky, is notable for being one of the oldest grain distilleries in Scotland, with a history dating back to the early 19th century. They're known for producing the grain spirit for many popular blends, so there's a good chance you've encountered their craftsmanship before, albeit in a different guise.

### Overall Rating: 3/5

**Summary:**
Cameron Brig is a simple, easy-drinking whisky that serves as a gentle introduction to the world of grain whisky. It's sweet, smooth, and friendly on the budget. While it won't dazzle with complexity, it offers a decent quality for its price point. It's a solid 3 out of 5, a good staple for those looking for an uncomplicated dram or a versatile mixer in their whisky repertoire.
