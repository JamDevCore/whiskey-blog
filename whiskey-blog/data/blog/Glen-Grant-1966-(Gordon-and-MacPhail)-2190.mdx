        # Glen Grant 1966 (Gordon and MacPhail) Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** $628.74

Whisky lovers, gather around. Today we're delving into a time capsule, the Glen Grant 1966 bottled by Gordon and MacPhail. This isn't just a bottle of whisky; it's a piece of history, an artefact that has patiently matured while the world around it spun on its axis. Let's uncork this beauty and see what the past has to whisper to our palates.

### First Impressions

The presentation of the Glen Grant 1966 is like a firm handshake from a bygone era. There's an elegance to the bottle that speaks of tradition and quality. At first glance, you can't help but feel you're about to experience something remarkable.

### The Flavour Journey

Upon nosing, you're greeted with a bouquet of fruitiness intertwined with gentle oak and a whisper of smokeâ€”nothing overpowering, just enough to pique your interest. The first sip is a soft revelation of mellow fruitiness, think apricots and ripe apples, with a honeyed sweetness that's as comforting as it is delightful.

The mid-palate reveals a dance of vanilla and a hint of spice, likely a nod to its time in the oak casks. The finish is where this whisky really shows its age, not with a shout but with a dignified bow. It's smooth, with a lingering warmth and a touch of those earlier fruity notes.

### Value for Money

Let's talk turkey. At a glance, the price tag might make your wallet wince, but remember, this is a vintage single malt we're talking about. It's not just a drink; it's an experience, an investment in a moment of pleasure that's been decades in the making. Is it good value? For the serious collector or the enthusiast looking to celebrate a momentous occasion, absolutely.

### Similar Whiskies

In the realm of aged single malts, you might compare this to a Glenfarclas Family Cask or perhaps a well-aged Macallan, though each will have its own unique character shaped by the years.

### The Story Behind the Bottle

Glen Grant, a distillery with roots deep in the Speyside region of Scotland, is known for its light, floral whiskies. Gordon and MacPhail, the renowned independent bottler, has a reputation for its exceptional cask selection and maturation expertise. This partnership is like a meeting of whisky nobility, and the result is nothing short of regal.

### Who Would Enjoy This?

This whisky would be a trophy for the collector, a bucket list dram for the enthusiast, and an eye-opener for the novice with a discerning palate and a healthy bank balance.

### Conclusion and Rating

The Glen Grant 1966 by Gordon and MacPhail is an eloquent testament to the art of whisky making and aging. It's a dram that commands respect and savouring, a liquid memoir of the year 1966.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** This whisky isn't just a drink; it's a journey through time. With its complex flavours, smooth finish, and the pedigree of its creators, it's a near-perfect embodiment of what an aged Speyside should be. It falls just short of perfection due to its price point which, while justified, puts it out of reach for many. For those who can indulge, it promises an unforgettable experience.
