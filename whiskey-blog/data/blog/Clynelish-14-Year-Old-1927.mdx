## First Impressions

Right out of the bottle, Clynelish 14 Year Old greets you with a golden amber hue that is reminiscent of the late afternoon sun. The bottle itself is quite traditional, nothing overly flashy, which suggests a confidence in the liquid it houses. It has a weightiness that feels good in the hand, hinting at the substance within.

## Flavour Profile

Upon the first nosing, Clynelish 14 offers a delightful bouquet of fruitiness with a hint of sea spray â€“ a nod to its coastal heritage. It's like standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean, with an orchard at your back.

The palate doesn't disappoint, either. It's brisk yet has a waxy, almost honeyed texture that coats your mouth. The initial sweetness of apple and citrus gives way to a warming, spicy kick of pepper and a subtle smokiness that's more a whisper of burnt heather than a billow of peat smoke. There's a complexity here that beckons you to take your time and explore.

The finish is long and satisfying, with a lingering spice and a slightly briny note that ties it all back to its maritime roots.
