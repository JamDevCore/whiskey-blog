        # Laphroaig Quarter Cask Whisky Review

**ABV:** 48%  
**Price:** £45.55

Laphroaig, a brand synonymous with the classic peaty punch of Islay Scotch, offers something a bit different with its Quarter Cask expression. At a robust 48% ABV and sitting at a comfortable mid-range price of £45.55, this whisky promises a complex dance of smoke and sweetness. Let's dive in and explore what makes the Laphroaig Quarter Cask a dram worth savoring.

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Laphroaig Quarter Cask doesn't stray far from the distillery's traditional aesthetic – the bottle is sturdy, with that unmistakable Laphroaig branding. Cracking it open, the peaty aroma is immediately noticeable, a hallmark of Islay scotch, but there's something else there—an inviting warmth that beckons a closer taste.

## Flavor Notes

The first sip hits you with Laphroaig's signature peat smoke, but it's not a one-note performance. The smaller cask size, from which the whisky takes its name, has worked its magic. The oak influence is pronounced, lending a creamy vanilla and coconut layer that intermingles with the peat. There are hints of citrus and a touch of caramel sweetness that balances the bold maritime brine. The finish is long, lingering with spice and an echo of the initial smoky blast.

## Value for Money

In terms of value, Laphroaig Quarter Cask punches above its weight. It delivers the complexity and depth you might expect from a pricier bottle. For enthusiasts looking to delve into peated whiskies without breaking the bank, this expression is a solid choice.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're fond of the Laphroaig Quarter Cask, you might also enjoy the Ardbeg 10 Year Old or the Lagavulin 16 Year Old. Both offer that smoky Islay character, though with different nuances – Ardbeg with a more medicinal, iodine quality, and Lagavulin with a richer, more rounded profile.

## Brand and Distillery

Laphroaig has a storied history dating back to 1815, and it's one of the few distilleries to still operate its own floor maltings. This dedication to traditional methods contributes to the distinctive Laphroaig taste. The Quarter Cask is a nod to the small casks used in the early days of whisky making, which impart more wood contact to the spirit and accelerate maturation.

## Summary

The Laphroaig Quarter Cask is a dram that delivers on all fronts – it's rich, peaty, and complex, with enough nuance to keep you coming back for more. It's approachable for newcomers to the peated whisky scene and deep enough for seasoned enthusiasts. Considering the price point and the quality on offer, it's a bottle that certainly deserves a spot on your shelf.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Laphroaig Quarter Cask is a beautifully balanced whisky that offers a symphony of smoke, oak, and sweetness. It's an excellent value for money, making it a must-try for both Islay lovers and those new to peated whisky. With its rich flavor profile and reasonable price, it's just shy of perfection, earning a well-deserved 4.5 out of 5.
