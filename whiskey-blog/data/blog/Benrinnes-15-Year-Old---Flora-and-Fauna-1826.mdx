        # Benrinnes 15 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**Brand:** Benrinnes  
**Age:** 15 Years Old  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £68.21

Nestled in the heart of Speyside, the Benrinnes distillery has a reputation for crafting sturdy, sherried malts that are rich in character. The 15 Year Old - part of the Flora and Fauna series - is a prime example of the distillery's signature style.

## First Impressions

The bottle itself, labeled with the distinctive Flora and Fauna artwork, suggests a connection to the natural world. Pouring a dram, you're greeted with a deep, amber hue that promises a full-bodied experience. The aroma is inviting, with hints of dried fruits and a subtle, spicy undertone.

## Flavor Profile

Upon the first sip, the 43% ABV delivers a warm, smooth entrance without overwhelming the palate. The whisky unfolds with layers of flavor - think Christmas cake and stewed fruits, with a hint of nuttiness. There's a pleasant balance of sweetness, with the sherry cask influence evident but not domineering, allowing the malt's complexity to shine through. A dash of water opens up softer notes of vanilla and perhaps a whisper of oak.

## Value for Money

Priced at just over £68, the Benrinnes 15 Year Old sits comfortably in the mid-range price bracket. Considering its age and the depth of flavor it offers, I'd argue it represents good value. It's a solid, well-aged Speyside malt that doesn't cut corners on quality.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of other sherried Speyside whiskies like the Aberlour 16 or GlenDronach 12, the Benrinnes 15 Year Old should be right up your alley. It offers a similar richness and depth but with its own distinctive twist.

## The Distillery and Brand

Benrinnes is a bit of an unsung hero in the whisky world. It's known for a unique partial triple distillation process, which is quite rare in Scotch whisky production and contributes to its full-bodied profile. The Flora and Fauna series showcases distilleries that typically don't have a wide range of official bottlings, making this 15 Year Old a special treat for enthusiasts looking to explore beyond the usual suspects.

## Conclusion

The Benrinnes 15 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a whisky that delivers a robust and satisfying Speyside experience. It's a dram that can be savored slowly, revealing more nuances with each sip. Whether you're a seasoned whisky drinker or a curious newcomer, this bottle is well worth exploring.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Benrinnes 15 Year Old is a delightful Speyside single malt offering rich, sherried flavors with enough complexity to keep you engaged throughout the entire glass. It stands as a testament to the distillery's craftsmanship and is a must-try for those who appreciate a well-rounded, mature whisky. It's nearly perfect, but as we whisky lovers know, the quest for the elusive '5' is part of the fun.
