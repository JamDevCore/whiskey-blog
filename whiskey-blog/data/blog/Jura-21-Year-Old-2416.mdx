        # Jura 21 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Jura  
**Age:** 21 Years  
**ABV:** 44%  
**Price:** £119.99

Welcome to the world of Jura, an island distillery known for crafting unique whiskies that capture the rugged essence of their coastal home. Today, we're delving into the Jura 21 Year Old, a matured spirit that promises complexity and refinement.

### First Impressions

Upon opening the bottle, you're greeted with an inviting, rich aroma. There's a hint of sea spray mingled with the sweetness of ripe fruit, suggesting a balance between the distillery's maritime heritage and the long years of maturation. The packaging, with its elegant bottle and presentation, speaks to the premium nature of this dram.

### Flavour Profile

The first sip reveals a tapestry of flavors. The whisky has a silky texture, and the 44% ABV provides a warm, but not overpowering, presence. You'll notice a dance of dried fruits, perhaps figs or raisins, playing with notes of dark chocolate and a whisper of smoke. As you continue to savor it, there's a delightful emergence of spices – think nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon. The finish is long and satisfying, leaving a slightly oaky, nutty aftertaste that beckons you back for another sip.

### Value for Money

At just under £120, the Jura 21 Year Old sits in a competitive price bracket for aged whiskies. Considering its age statement and the depth of flavor offered, it presents reasonable value for those who appreciate the nuances of a well-aged Scotch. It's not the cheapest option out there, but for a special occasion or as a gift, it certainly has its place.

### Comparable Whiskies

Whisky lovers might draw parallels to the likes of the Old Pulteney 21 or the Glenfiddich 21, which also bring forward aged complexity with coastal influences. Each has its own character, but Jura 21 Year Old stands out with its unique island profile.

### The Jura Brand

Jura is a distillery steeped in history, hailing from an island with a population of around 200 people. It's a place where whisky making is at the heart of community life. The brand prides itself on its heritage and the distinct qualities imparted by the island's terroir. This 21 Year Old expression is a testament to their dedication to the craft.

### Final Thoughts

The Jura 21 Year Old is a whisky that tells a story in each glass – a story of time, patience, and the spirit of its island home. It's a dram that calls for contemplation and appreciation, ideal for those evenings when you want to slow down and savor the moment.

### Rating: 4/5

**Summary:** A well-crafted whisky with a rich tapestry of flavors suitable for a special occasion. It offers a journey through the essence of Jura, with a price that reflects its aged sophistication. While not the most accessible for every budget, it's a worthy indulgence for those seeking a mature and complex dram.

Cheers to your next whisky adventure!
