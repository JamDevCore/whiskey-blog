        # Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee Whisky Review

**Whisky Name:** Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee  
**Brand:** Highland Malt  
**Price:** £74.99  
**ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

The Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee is a quirky bottle, designed to capture the hearts of golf enthusiasts and whisky collectors alike. It's an eye-catching presentation that could easily become a conversation starter on your shelf. The price point suggests that this isn't just a novelty item, but a serious contender in the single malt category.

## Tasting Notes

Upon opening the bottle, the aroma is inviting with hints of green apples, vanilla, and a subtle peatiness that's characteristic of many Highland malts. Taking the first sip, the smoothness is immediately apparent. It's a gentle introduction to the palate with a well-balanced mix of sweetness and spice. The flavors are not overly complex but pleasant, showcasing traditional notes of oak, honey, and a touch of heather.

The finish is medium-length, leaving a warm and slightly dry sensation that makes you reach for another sip. At 40% ABV, it's quite approachable, even for those new to whisky.

## Value for Money

At around £75, this whisky sits in a competitive price bracket. It's not the most budget-friendly option, but it's not exorbitantly priced either. For a specialty bottle like this, you're partly paying for the unique design. If you're a golfer who loves whisky, the additional cost might be justified for the novelty alone.

## Similar Whiskies

If you enjoy the Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee, you might also appreciate other accessible Highland single malts like Glenmorangie Original or Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old. These whiskies share a similar profile of being easy-drinking with a pleasant mix of fruit and floral notes.

## The Brand and the Experience

Highland Malt has managed to merge the world of whisky with golf, offering a product that's as much a keepsake as it is a drink. It's a smart move that taps into a niche market and could very well be the perfect gift for someone who spends as much time on the fairway as they do nosing a dram.

The experience of drinking Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee is enjoyable. It's a whisky that doesn't demand your full attention, making it suitable for a casual drink after a day on the golf course or during a relaxed evening with friends.

## Summary and Rating: 3.5/5

The Highland Malt Golf Ball On Tee is a solid whisky with a fun twist. It's smooth, easy to drink, and has enough character to be enjoyed by both casual drinkers and enthusiasts. Its unique bottle design adds to its charm, although the price may be a tad steep for the casual buyer. Overall, it's a commendable effort that scores a **3.5 out of 5**. It's not the pinnacle of whisky craftsmanship, but it's a decent dram that doubles as a great gift for golf lovers.
