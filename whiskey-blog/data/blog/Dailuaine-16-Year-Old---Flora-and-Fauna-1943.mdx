        # Review of Dailuaine 16 Year Old - Flora and Fauna

**Brand:** Dailuaine  
**Age:** 16 Years  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £73.09

Walking into the world of whisky, you'll find the Dailuaine 16 Year Old nestled comfortably within the Flora and Fauna series—a range that showcases the lesser-known distilleries of Scotland. This Speyside gem is a curious bottle for both the seasoned whisky drinker and the eager newcomer.

## First Impressions

The packaging is nothing if not classic, with the Flora and Fauna label depicting the wildlife native to the distillery's surroundings. It's an inviting bottle, one that promises a traditional Speyside experience. The whisky itself holds a deep amber hue, suggesting a richness waiting to be explored.

## On the Nose

Bringing the glass to your nose, Dailuaine 16 greets you with a bouquet of sweet, malty aromas. There's a whisper of fruitiness—perhaps stewed apples or pears—and a subtle hint of nuttiness. It's not an overpowering aroma but rather a gentle invitation to take the first sip.

## On the Palate

The first sip confirms the nose's promises. The maltiness is there, along with a delightful fruit compote sweetness. It's a medium-bodied whisky, with a creamy texture that coats the palate, offering up flavors of caramel, vanilla, and a slight spiciness reminiscent of nutmeg or cinnamon. The oak influence is apparent but not domineering, providing a nice structure to the dram.

## Finish

The finish is warm and lingering. It leaves behind a pleasant, slightly dry oakiness and a memory of spice that makes you want to take another sip.

## Value for Money

At around £73, Dailuaine 16 Year Old holds its own in the price category. It's not the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but for a 16-year-old single malt, it offers a good balance between age, complexity, and cost. It's a solid choice for those looking to explore beyond the usual suspects without breaking the bank.

## Similar Whiskies

If you're a fan of the Dailuaine 16, you might also enjoy other Speyside whiskies like the Benrinnes 15 Year Old or the Mortlach 16 Year Old. These whiskies share a similar weight and complexity, each with their unique twist on the Speyside character.

## The Distillery

Dailuaine is often considered a workhorse distillery, providing malt for blends, and it's not often found as a single malt. This adds a layer of intrigue and rarity to the experience, as you're tasting a dram that's not always in the limelight but certainly deserves its moment to shine.

## The Verdict

Dailuaine 16 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a well-rounded, satisfying Speyside whisky. It balances traditional flavors with enough complexity to keep you engaged throughout the entire glass. It's approachable enough for newcomers and interesting enough for connoisseurs.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** A hidden Speyside treasure, the Dailuaine 16 Year Old offers a classic experience with just enough complexity to stand out. Its warm, spiced, and fruity profile combined with a reasonable price point makes it a worthy addition to any whisky collection.
