        # Glen Grant 1962 (Gordon and MacPhail) Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £847.52

When you encounter a whisky as venerable as the Glen Grant 1962 bottled by Gordon and MacPhail, you're not just sipping a dram; you're delving into a liquid history book. This is a spirit that has seen decades pass by, quietly maturing in its cask, waiting for the perfect moment to be enjoyed.

### First Impressions

The presentation of this whisky suggests a classic and refined experience. The bottle and labeling reflect the heritage and the long journey this particular whisky has made from cask to glass.

### Flavor and Aroma

Upon first nosing, you're greeted with a bouquet of aromas that speak of its age. There's a rich fruitiness, reminiscent of orchard fruits like ripe apples and pears, layered with a hint of nuttiness and the deep, sweet scent of toffee. The age of the whisky has allowed these flavors to meld and mature into a complex profile that's both inviting and intriguing.

Taking the first sip, the flavor unfolds gracefully on the palate. The fruitiness from the nose is present, along with a subtle oakiness that whispers tales of its long rest in wooden casks. There's a lightness to it, which is characteristic of the Glen Grant distillery, but with a depth that only time can bestow upon a whisky. It's smooth, with a gentle warmth that doesn't overpower but rather complements the dance of flavors.

### Value for Money

At a price point of £847.52, this is certainly a whisky that falls into the category of a luxury purchase. It's not an everyday dram but rather a special occasion whisky. When considering its age and uniqueness, it can be seen as a worthwhile investment for collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate the historical significance and rarity of such an old bottle.

### Comparable Whiskies

In the realm of aged whiskies, you might draw comparisons to offerings like The Glenlivet 50 Year Old or a Macallan 1962. These are also prestigious bottles with hefty price tags, revered for their age and the craftsmanship that goes into their production.

### The Brand and Its Heritage

Glen Grant is a name that carries weight in the whisky world. Founded in 1840, this Speyside distillery has a reputation for producing whiskies with a light, floral character, and the Gordon and MacPhail bottling of the 1962 vintage is a testament to their expertise. It's a collaboration between distillery and bottler that showcases the skill of both parties.

### Conclusion

The Glen Grant 1962 (Gordon and MacPhail) is a remarkable time capsule that offers more than just a drink—it's a journey through the past, a taste of history. It's a whisky that commands respect and contemplation with each sip, and it's a privilege to experience a spirit that has been so carefully crafted and preserved.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Glen Grant 1962 is an extraordinary whisky, offering complexity and a rare glimpse into the past. Its price reflects its exclusivity and age, making it a splurge for most but potentially a worthy addition for the serious collector or enthusiast. Its smooth, rich flavors and the story it tells with each drop make it a near-perfect dram, falling just shy of perfection only because of its accessibility to the average whisky lover.
