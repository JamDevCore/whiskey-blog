        # Nevis Dew Special Reserve Review

**Brand:** Ben Nevis  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £20.9

### First Impressions
Nevis Dew Special Reserve, from the Ben Nevis distillery, greets you with a straightforward presentation that suggests a no-nonsense approach to whisky making. The price point is quite inviting, making it an accessible option for those looking to explore the world of Scotch without breaking the bank.

### Flavour Profile
Upon the first sip, Nevis Dew Special Reserve offers a gentle introduction to the palate. It's a blend that doesn't overpower but instead provides a smooth and somewhat mellow experience. The whisky carries a light sweetness reminiscent of ripe fruits, perhaps apples or pears, with a subtle hint of vanilla from its time spent in oak barrels.

The body is on the lighter side, which is typical for a 40% ABV whisky, making it an easy sipper for a relaxed evening. There's a touch of peat smoke, but it's more of a whisper in the background rather than a shout, which is quite characteristic of some Highland whiskies.

### Value for Money
At just under £21, Nevis Dew Special Reserve is what many would consider good value for money. It's not going to compete with the complexity and depth of higher-tier, aged whiskies, but it's not trying to. For its price, it offers a pleasant experience that won't disappoint the casual drinker.

### Comparisons and Brand Info
Ben Nevis Distillery, nestled at the foot of its namesake mountain in Scotland, has a history dating back to 1825. They are known for producing a variety of whiskies that often fly under the radar. Nevis Dew Special Reserve is a testament to their ability to create approachable blends.

In comparison, you might find similarities with other entry-level Scotch blends like Famous Grouse or Teacher's Highland Cream, which also offer that easy-drinking experience without too much complexity.

### Summary
Nevis Dew Special Reserve is a solid choice for those new to Scotch or for anyone seeking a simple, enjoyable dram that won't challenge the palate too much. It's certainly a step up from the bottom shelf, and its price makes it a smart buy for casual enjoyment.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** Nevis Dew Special Reserve is an approachable, budget-friendly Scotch that serves as a gentle introduction to the world of whisky. While it may lack the complexity desired by connoisseurs, it makes for an easy and enjoyable sip that represents good value for money.
