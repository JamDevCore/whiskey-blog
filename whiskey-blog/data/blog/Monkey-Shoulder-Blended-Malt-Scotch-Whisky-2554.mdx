        # Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky Review

Monkey Shoulder has become a bit of a darling in the whisky world, especially among those looking for a solid blend without breaking the bank. So, let's dive into this approachable tipple and see what all the fuss is about.

**ABV:** 40%
**Price:** £32.70

## First Impressions
Right out of the bottle, you're greeted with an inviting golden amber hue that promises warmth and richness. The label is playful, featuring three monkeys on the shoulder of the bottle, a nod to the traditional malt-men who suffered from a temporary condition known as 'monkey shoulder' from long shifts of turning barley by hand.

## Flavor Profile
On the nose, Monkey Shoulder is sweet and fruity. You'll pick up hints of zesty orange, vanilla, and perhaps a whisper of honey and spiced oak. It's not an overcomplicated aroma, but it's pleasantly balanced.

Taking that first sip, the malt really shines through. It's creamy with a delightful malty sweetness, accompanied by flavors of butterscotch and a touch of cinnamon. The finish is smooth with a subtle spicy kick that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's not the most complex whisky you'll ever taste, but it's incredibly easy to drink and has enough character to keep you interested.

## Value for Money
At just over $30, Monkey Shoulder positions itself as an excellent value proposition. It's a blended malt, which means it's a blend of single malts, and no grain whisky is involved. This often results in a smoother, more refined flavor profile, and Monkey Shoulder delivers on this front. It's versatile too – great straight, on the rocks, or as a base for cocktails.

## Comparable Whiskies
If you're a fan of Monkey Shoulder, you might also enjoy other accessible blends like Johnnie Walker Black Label or Chivas Regal 12 Year. These whiskies also strive for a balance between quality and affordability, though each has its unique flavor profile.

## Brand and Background
Monkey Shoulder is produced by William Grant & Sons, a family-owned distillery with a good reputation for quality spirits. They've managed to create a modern brand image without sacrificing the craftsmanship expected from a Scotch whisky.

## Summary
Monkey Shoulder is a testament to the beauty of blended malt Scotch. It's an excellent entry point for those new to whisky and a reliable go-to for veterans. The balance of quality and price makes it a staple for any home bar.

**Rating: 4/5**

Monkey Shoulder is a crowd-pleaser with its smooth, sweet, and approachable profile. It's not going to knock the socks off the most discerning of whisky drinkers, but it's an undeniably good time in a glass. For its price, it's a solid purchase, earning it a well-deserved 4 out of 5.
