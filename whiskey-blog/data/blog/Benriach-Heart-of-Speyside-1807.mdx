        # Benriach Heart of Speyside Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £30.90

Nestled in the lush greenery of Speyside, Scotland, the Benriach distillery offers a dram that promises to capture the essence of this renowned whisky region. The 'Heart of Speyside' is an entry-level offering that aims to provide a glimpse into the brand's character without breaking the bank.

### First Impressions

Upon pouring, the whisky greets you with a warm, amber glow, reminiscent of the late afternoon sun piercing through the Scottish mist. It's approachable and unassuming, with a simple bottle design that whispers rather than shouts.

### Flavor Profile

As you take the first sip, the 'Heart of Speyside' unfolds gently on the palate. There's a sweetness there, akin to fresh orchard fruits – think apples and pears with a drizzle of honey. The classic Speyside maltiness is present, offering a soft, biscuity note that's comforting and familiar.

Midway, a wave of mild spices emerges, a nod to the casks that once cradled the spirit. These spices don't overwhelm; instead, they provide a pleasant warmth that balances the sweetness. The finish is moderate, leaving a hint of vanilla and oak that lingers just long enough to invite another sip.

### Value for Money

At just under £31, this bottle sits comfortably in the 'daily dram' category. It's not a whisky that demands contemplation but rather one that offers easy enjoyment. For beginners or those looking to explore Speyside without a steep investment, it's a solid choice.

### Comparable Whiskies

If you find pleasure in the 'Heart of Speyside,' you might also enjoy the Glenlivet Founder's Reserve or the Glenfiddich 12 Year Old. Both offer that quintessential Speyside charm at a similar price point.

### The Brand and Its Charm

Benriach, while not as widely recognized as some of its Speyside cousins, has a history dating back to the late 19th century. The distillery has seen its share of ups and downs, yet it remains a testament to traditional whisky-making. The 'Heart of Speyside' is a tribute to the distillery's resilience and dedication to craft.

### Conclusion

What the Benriach Heart of Speyside lacks in complexity, it makes up for in drinkability and charm. It's a straightforward, no-frills Speyside malt that serves as a welcoming gateway to the region's flavors.

**Rating:** 3.5/5
