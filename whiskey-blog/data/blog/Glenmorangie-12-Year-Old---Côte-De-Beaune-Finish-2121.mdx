## Flavour Notes

Upon uncorking, the aroma is a bouquet of fruit and oak, thanks to its wine cask finish. The first sip greets you with the classic Glenmorangie smoothness, followed by a complex layering of flavors. Stone fruits, hints of almond, and a subtle spiciness dance around the palate. The wine cask finishing adds a nuanced depth, with a slight berry tartness and an oaky warmth rounding out the taste.

For those new to wine cask-finished whiskies, this Glenmorangie offers a beautiful example of how wine influences can elegantly intertwine with the character of Scotch whisky.

## Value for Money

Clocking in at $399, this isn't your everyday dram. It's a special occasion whisky that demands contemplation. When it comes to value, it's a matter of perspective. For aficionados who appreciate the delicate infusion of wine cask flavors, it may be a worthy investment.

## Comparisons and Context

In the landscape of wine-finished Scotch, this Glenmorangie holds its own. It's more affordable than some of the ultra-premium offerings but more expensive than the likes of Glenfiddich's 15 Year Old Solera Vat, which also boasts a wine cask finish at a more accessible price point.

## Final Verdict

**Rating**: 4/5

The Glenmorangie 12 Year Old - Côte De Beaune Finish is a beautiful symphony of Scotch whisky and French winemaking. Its complexity and depth of flavor make it a standout, but the price may be a barrier for some. It's a solid 4 out of 5 for those who appreciate the craft and can afford the splurge.
