        # Compass Box The Peat Monster Review

**ABV:** 46%  
**Price:** Approx. $43

**First Impressions:**  
The Peat Monster by Compass Box greets you with a name that sets a smoky expectation right from the get-go. The bottle design is modern and artistic, typical of Compass Box's branding, which often stands out on the shelf for its creativity. Upon opening the bottle, the peat-forward aroma is evident, but it doesn't overwhelm; there's a sense of balance even in the scent.

**Flavour Profile:**  
Taking the first sip, The Peat Monster lives up to its name, delivering a robust peatiness that's characteristic of Islay whiskies. However, it's not a one-dimensional peat bomb. There's complexity here with layers of fruitiness, a touch of vanilla, and a whisper of sea salt. The mouthfeel is smooth, and the finish is long, with the smokiness lingering pleasantly.

**Value for Money:**  
At around $43, The Peat Monster is priced competitively, especially considering the quality and complexity it offers. It stands as good value for anyone looking to explore peated whiskies without breaking the bank. It's a solid option for both peat lovers and those curious about dipping their toes into smokier waters.

**Similar Whiskies:**  
If you're a fan of Islay whiskies like Laphroaig or Ardbeg, The Peat Monster offers a similar experience but with a unique twist that's the hallmark of Compass Box's blending expertise. It's less medicinal than some of its Islay counterparts, making it a great middle ground for a wider range of palates.

**Brand Info:**  
Compass Box is known for its innovative approach to blending and has made a name for itself as a craft whisky maker. They're not bound by tradition, which allows them to experiment and produce blends that challenge and expand the whisky drinker's expectations. The Peat Monster is a testament to their craft, showcasing their ability to create a harmonious blend of peaty whiskies.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:**  
Compass Box The Peat Monster is a well-crafted blended malt that offers a complex, smoky experience without being overpowering. It's a superb value for the price, making it accessible for those who want to explore peated Scotch without committing to the higher price tags some single malts demand. It's engaging, approachable, and a fine representation of what Compass Box does bestâ€”pushing the boundaries of blending while maintaining quality and drinkability.
