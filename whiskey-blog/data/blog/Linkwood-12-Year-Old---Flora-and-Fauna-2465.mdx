        # Linkwood 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £61.03

## First Impressions

The Linkwood 12 Year Old is part of the revered Flora and Fauna series, which immediately gives it a certain charm. The bottle design is quaint, with illustrations that hark back to a bygone era of whisky-making. It's an inviting presentation that sets the stage for what's inside.

## Flavor and Experience

Upon opening the bottle, the aroma is a subtle blend of fresh fruits and floral notes, with a hint of oakiness that whispers of its 12-year maturation. Taking the first sip, the whisky is remarkably smooth, with a medium body that coats the palate without overwhelming it.

The flavor profile is a delightful journey starting with sweet orchard fruits like apples and pears, which then transition into a dance of light spices and a floral bouquet. The finish is gentle and lingering, with a touch of vanilla and malt that rounds out the experience.

## Value for Money

At just over 60 bucks, Linkwood 12 offers a solid experience that won't break the bank. It's a good value for a 12-year-old single malt, especially one that's part of a collectible series. It's not the cheapest whisky on the shelf, but the quality and complexity you get in return make it worth the price of admission.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of the Linkwood 12, you might also enjoy the Glenfiddich 12 Year Old for its similar fruit-forward profile and approachability. Another comparable whisky would be the Balvenie 12 Year Old DoubleWood, which shares the Linkwood's penchant for fruit and spice, albeit with a bit more emphasis on the wood influence.

## The Brand and Distillery

The Linkwood distillery has been around since 1821, nestled in Speyside, Scotland's whisky heartland. It's known for producing whiskies that are quintessentially Speyside in character—fruity, floral, and graceful. The Flora and Fauna series is a nod to the natural beauty surrounding the distillery and showcases the traditional craftsmanship that goes into their whiskies.
