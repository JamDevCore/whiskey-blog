        # Tomintoul with a Peaty Tang Whisky Review

**Brand:** Tomintoul  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** Â£37.07

## First Impressions

Tomintoul, often referred to as 'the gentle dram', takes an intriguing turn with its 'Peaty Tang' expression. Right off the bat, the name suggests a dance between the traditional smoothness of Tomintoul and the boldness of peat. The bottle design is consistent with the Tomintoul line, unassuming yet elegant, hinting at the no-frills quality of the whisky within.

## Flavour Journey

Upon first pour, the 'Peaty Tang' greets you with a subtle smokiness, not overpowering but rather inviting. It's a whisper of a campfire rather than a blazing bonfire, which aligns with Tomintoul's reputation for restraint and balance.

As you take a sip, the peat reveals itself more assertively, yet it's well-mannered, playing nicely with the malt's inherent sweetness. There's a surprising lightness to the body, considering the peaty character, and the finish is medium-long, leaving a satisfying earthiness tinged with hints of vanilla and oak.

The 40% ABV means it's gentle enough for those new to peated whiskies, while still offering enough complexity to keep the seasoned whisky drinker engaged.

## Value for Money

Priced at just over $37, Tomintoul with a Peaty Tang is positioned as an affordable entry into the world of peat without compromising on quality. It may not have the depth of its older, more expensive siblings, but it certainly delivers on its promise of a peaty 'tang'. For those looking to explore peated Scotch without diving into the deep end, this dram offers a fantastic introduction.

## Comparisons and Brand Background

Tomintoul is nestled in the Speyside region of Scotland, an area not typically known for peated whiskies. This makes 'Peaty Tang' a bit of an outlier, offering a contrast to the brand's usual style. When compared to other peated expressions like Laphroaig or Ardbeg, Tomintoul's version is much less intense, making it a good stepping stone.

The brand itself has a history of crafting approachable, high-quality whiskies, and 'Peaty Tang' is a testament to their versatility and willingness to experiment within their profile.

## Conclusion

Tomintoul with a Peaty Tang is like a gentle hike through the Scottish highlands, where the peat bogs leave their imprint on the air and on your palate. It's a dram that's easy to enjoy, balancing smokiness with the distillery's characteristic smoothness. It's a welcoming pour for those just venturing into the peaty waters and a pleasant change of pace for the peat-accustomed.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** Tomintoul with a Peaty Tang offers a light and approachable peated experience, well-suited to those curious about smoky whiskies. With its fair price point and balanced flavor profile, it's a commendable choice for both newcomers and seasoned drinkers looking for a milder peat influence.
