As you take the first sip, the smoothness is immediately apparent, a testament to its age. The palate is complex, with layers of flavors that unfold slowly. You might detect a hint of fruitiness, perhaps dried figs or raisins, intermingled with a gentle oakiness and a whisper of smoke that speaks to its time in the cask. The finish is long, warm, and surprisingly fresh for a spirit of this age, leaving behind a subtle sweetness and a hint of spice.
