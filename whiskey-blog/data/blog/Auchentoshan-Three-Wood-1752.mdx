        # Auchentoshan Three Wood Whisky Review

**Brand:** Auchentoshan  
**Price:** $50.68  
**ABV:** 43%

Welcome to another whisky review, where today we're diving into a bottle of Auchentoshan Three Wood. This Lowland single malt scotch has a unique triple maturation process, which promises a complex and rich experience.

## First Impressions

At first glance, the Auchentoshan Three Wood has an alluring, deep amber color that suggests a richness waiting to be discovered. The bottle design is elegant yet understated, hinting at the traditional craftsmanship this distillery is known for.

## Flavor Journey

Taking a sip, the whisky greets you with a velvety smoothness. The initial sweetness, reminiscent of dark fruits and molasses, unfolds into a dance of nuttiness and spice. The layers of flavor are a testament to its maturation in three different types of barrels: American bourbon, Spanish Oloroso sherry, and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks.

The finish is long and warm, with a lingering spice that invites you to take another sip. The sherry influence is unmistakable, with a complexity that belies its reasonable price point.

## Value for Money

Speaking of price, at just over $50, Auchentoshan Three Wood offers an exceptional experience for its cost. It's a whisky that could easily go head-to-head with more expensive counterparts, making it a smart buy for both casual sippers and seasoned enthusiasts.

## Similar Whiskies

If you're a fan of the sherry influence in your whisky, you might also enjoy the GlenDronach 12 Year Old or the Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old. Both offer that delightful marriage of sweetness and spice, though each has its own distinctive character.

## The Distillery and Its Craft

Auchentoshan, known for its triple-distilled spirits, is one of the few remaining Lowland distilleries. This dedication to triple distillation is rare in Scotland and gives their whiskies a signature smoothness. The Three Wood is a shining example of their craftsmanship and innovation.

## Conclusion and Rating

**Rating:** 4.5/5

The Auchentoshan Three Wood is a whisky that impresses with its complexity and depth. It's a dram that can be enjoyed by newcomers and connoisseurs alike, offering a rich tapestry of flavors without overwhelming the palate. The value for money is excellent, and it stands as a proud representation of the Auchentoshan distillery's heritage and expertise. A solid 4.5 out of 5 for this delightful whisky. Cheers to a dram well-made!
