## Flavor Notes

Cracking open the bottle, you're greeted with a bouquet of light floral notes, a hint of vanilla, and a touch of fresh fruit. The aroma is inviting, not overpowering, which sets up a nice prelude to the tasting experience.

Upon sipping, the 40% ABV delivers a gentle warmth that's very much in line with the Speyside character.
