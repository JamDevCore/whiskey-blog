        # Ardbeg Renaissance 10 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Ardbeg  
**Age:** 10 Years  
**ABV:** 55.9%  
**Price:** Approx. $450

When you hear the name Ardbeg, you're likely to think of peat, smoke, and a rich history of whisky-making on the Scottish Isle of Islay. Ardbeg Renaissance is a celebration of that tradition, marking the culmination of a series of releases leading up to their 10-year-old expression.

## First Impressions

The Ardbeg Renaissance comes in the distillery's signature bottle, exuding a sense of mystery and tradition. The high ABV of 55.9% suggests a robust experience ahead. At first glance, the price tag of around $450 might raise eyebrows, but let's delve into the dram to see if the experience justifies the cost.

## Flavour Journey

Upon nosing, the Renaissance greets you with a potent wave of Islay's coastal character â€” think seaweed and brine, mixed with the unmistakable Ardbeg peat smoke. But there's more than just smoke; hints of vanilla and a citrus zest round out the aromatic profile.

Taking a sip, the high ABV delivers a bold punch. It's a full-bodied whisky where peat remains the star, but it's not a one-dimensional peat bomb. Layers unfold with smoked fruits, a touch of oak, and a sweetness reminiscent of honey and lemon. Adding a few drops of water can open it up even further, softening the intensity and revealing subtler nuances like spices and a gentle nuttiness.

## Value for Money

Is Ardbeg Renaissance worth the $450 price tag? For the casual drinker, this might be steep. However, for the whisky aficionado who appreciates the craftsmanship and story behind a bottle, it can be considered a worthwhile investment. It's a limited edition, after all, so part of what you're paying for is exclusivity.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're looking for alternatives, you might consider other Ardbeg expressions like the Uigeadail or Corryvreckan, which offer peaty complexity at a lower price point. Outside of Ardbeg, whiskies like Lagavulin 16 Year Old or Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength might scratch a similar itch for peat lovers.

## The Brand

Ardbeg has a cult following, and for a good reason. Their whiskies consistently deliver quality and complexity. The Renaissance is a nod to Ardbeg's rebirth and return to form, following a tumultuous period in the 1980s and 1990s.

## Summary

The Ardbeg Renaissance is a whisky that commands attention. With its high ABV and intense flavors, it's not for the faint of heart. It's a celebration of Islay peat, offering complexity and depth that will reward those who appreciate such characteristics.

**Rating:** 4/5

The Ardbeg Renaissance 10 Year Old is a peat-lover's treasure, and while the price is on the higher end, it's a commendable dram with a story to tell. It earns a solid 4 out of 5, with points for flavor depth and character, but a slight deduction for a price that might limit its accessibility.
