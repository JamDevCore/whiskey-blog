        # Glenfarclas 105 Review

**Brand:** Glenfarclas  
**ABV:** 60%  
**Price:** £28.24 for 35cl

Glenfarclas is a name that carries a certain reverence in the world of whisky. As I sit down with a dram of Glenfarclas 105, I'm immediately struck by the robustness of this cask-strength beast. It's a Highland single malt that doesn't shy away from its potent ABV, and for those unfamiliar with cask strength, that means it's bottled directly from the cask without dilution, capturing the full flavor and strength of the spirit.

### First Impressions

The bottle itself has an inviting, classic look, and pouring the whisky into the glass, I'm greeted with a rich, amber hue that promises a deep and engaging experience. At first nosing, the alcohol is palpable, but give it a moment to breathe and you'll start to uncover layers of dried fruits, a hint of oak, and a whisper of toffee.

### The Flavor Journey

Now, onto the palate. This is where the Glenfarclas 105 really starts to sing. Despite the high ABV, there's a surprising smoothness here. The initial heat from the alcohol gives way to a symphony of flavors: Christmas cake, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a delightful sherry sweetness that Glenfarclas is known for, thanks to their use of sherry casks for aging. This is a whisky that demands your attention, and with each sip, you'll find more to explore. A splash of water can help to open it up further, softening the blow of the alcohol and revealing more of the complex character.

### Value for Money

At £28.24 for a 35cl bottle, Glenfarclas 105 sits in a bit of a unique spot. It's not your everyday sipper, given the strength, but it's also not priced out of reach. Considering the depth and richness of flavor, and the fact that it's a cask-strength whisky from a reputable distillery, I'd argue that it offers good value for money, especially for those looking to experience something with a bit more kick.

### Similar Whiskies

When considering alternatives, you might look at other cask-strength offerings like Aberlour A'Bunadh or even Glenlivet Nadurra. While each has its own distinct profile, they share that same uncut, unfiltered approach to whisky that delivers a powerful and pure taste experience.

### The Glenfarclas Distillery

Glenfarclas has been a family-run distillery since 1865, and their dedication to tradition is evident in every bottle. They're one of the few distilleries that still privately owned and operated by the founding family, the Grants, which adds a personal touch to their whiskies. They're known for their sherry cask maturation, which imparts that signature richness and depth of flavor.

### Final Thoughts

Glenfarclas 105 is a whisky that commands respect. It's not the kind of dram you'd throw back without a thought, but rather one to savor slowly, ideally on a quiet evening when you have the time to appreciate its complexities.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** Glenfarclas 105 is a robust, flavorful cask-strength whisky that offers depth, warmth, and a great sherry influence. It's reasonably priced for its quality and provides an excellent introduction to stronger whiskies without breaking the bank. While not for the faint of heart, it's a rewarding dram for those who dare to delve into its potent charms.
