        # Robert Burns Blended Scotch Whisky Review

**Brand:** Arran  
**Price:** $20.29  
**ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Robert Burns Blended Scotch Whisky carries an air of modest charm, reflective of the poet after whom it's named. It's priced as an everyday dram at just over twenty bucks, which means it's not trying to put on airsâ€”it knows its audience. The bottle design is straightforward and unassuming, much like the contents within.

## Flavor Profile

Cracking open the bottle, you're met with a gentle waft of malt and a hint of fruitiness. It's not an overbearing scent, but it does beckon you for a taste. On the palate, the Robert Burns blend is approachably smooth, with a light body that makes it an easy sipper. You'll catch hints of apple and a whisper of vanilla, followed by a subtle smokiness that's more of a nod than a declaration. The finish is short to medium, leaving a slightly sweet and woody aftertaste that doesn't overstay its welcome.

## Value for Money

At around $20, this whisky is what you'd call a "bang for your buck." It's not going to blow your mind, but it's not trying to. Instead, it's a reliable choice for a casual evening dram or a mixer in a whisky-forward cocktail. It's also a good stepping stone for those just venturing into the world of Scotch without breaking the bank.

## Similar Whiskies

If you're looking for similar experiences, you might try whiskies like the Famous Grouse or Teacher's Highland Cream. These blends share a similar price point and flavor profile, offering that accessible entry into Scotch whisky without the complexity (or cost) of single malts.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

The Arran distillery, which produces the Robert Burns Blended Scotch Whisky, is relatively young in the whisky world, established only in 1995. However, they've quickly made a name for themselves with a range of respected single malts. This particular blend pays tribute to Scotland's beloved poet, Robert Burns, who was known for his appreciation of the common man's pleasures, including a good Scotch.

## Conclusion

The Robert Burns Blended Scotch Whisky by Arran is a no-frills, honest dram that's perfect for unwinding after a long day. It's not going to challenge your palate or redefine your whisky experience, but it's not meant to. Instead, it's a solid, enjoyable blend that's easy to share with friends, regardless of their whisky expertise.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** A straightforward and pleasant blended Scotch that represents good value for money. It's a fitting homage to the everyman's poet, Robert Burns, and a commendable offering from the Arran distillery for those seeking simplicity and reliability in their whisky.
