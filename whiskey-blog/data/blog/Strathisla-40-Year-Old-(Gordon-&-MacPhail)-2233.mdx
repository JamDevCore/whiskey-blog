        # Strathisla 40 Year Old (Gordon & MacPhail) Review

**ABV**: 43%  
**Price**: $1578.95

Stepping into the realm of venerable spirits, the Strathisla 40 Year Old, bottled by the esteemed independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail, is a journey through time and craftsmanship. This whisky, with its deep roots in the Speyside tradition, promises a narrative in each sip. Let's unravel the tale woven by this aged ambassador of Strathisla.

## First Impressions

The presentation of this whisky speaks volumes before the cork is even popped. Encased in a bottle that whispers of tradition and prestige, the deep amber liquid hints at the decades it has spent maturing. The initial aroma is a complex bouquet of oak, ripe fruits, and a subtle, refined sweetness that sets the stage for what's to come.

## Flavour Journey

Upon the first sip, the Strathisla 40 Year Old reveals its layers. The palate is greeted with a harmonious blend of dried fruits, notably raisins and figs, dancing with a spicy oakiness that's been mellowed by time. Hints of chocolate and a whisper of smoke lend it a richness that's neither overpowering nor underwhelming.

The mouthfeel is silky, a testament to its age, and the finish is long and warming, leaving behind a pleasant, lingering spiciness with just a touch of leather and tobacco - a nod to its long maturation period.

## Value for Money

With a price tag of nearly $1600, this is certainly a whisky that represents a significant investment. However, for a 40-year-old malt of this caliber, the price is justifiable, especially when considering the rarity and the meticulous care that goes into bottling such an aged spirit. It's a collector's item and a special occasion dram, rather than an everyday tipple.

## Comparisons and Context

In the sphere of well-aged Scotch whiskies, the Strathisla 40 Year Old stands its ground against other prestigious offerings like the Glenfarclas 40 or even some of the older expressions from Glenfiddich. Each has its own character, but what sets the Strathisla apart is the unique signature that Gordon & MacPhail's curation brings to the table, often resulting in a whisky that's both traditional and distinct.

## The Whisky and the Brand

Strathisla distillery, nestled in the heart of Speyside, is known as one of the oldest operating distilleries in Scotland. Gordon & MacPhail, on the other hand, have built a reputation for selecting and maturing top-notch whiskies from various distilleries, often releasing expressions that are celebrated for their quality and complexity.

## Summary

The Strathisla 40 Year Old (Gordon & MacPhail) is a whisky that commands respect. It's a testament to the art of aging, blending the best of Strathisla's distilling prowess with Gordon & MacPhail's patient maturation process. While it's a significant financial outlay, for the whisky aficionado looking to experience the upper echelons of aged Scotch, it's a worthwhile indulgence.

**Rating**: 4.5/5  
**Summary**: A stunning example of aged Speyside whisky, the Strathisla 40 Year Old is a symphony of complex flavors and a showcase of the beauty of time's influence on Scotch. Perfect for a special occasion or as a crowning jewel in a collector's cabinet, itâ€™s a near-perfect dram that falls just short of a full 5 due to its price making it less accessible for casual enjoyment.
