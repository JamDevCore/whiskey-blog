        # Balblair 10 Year Old 35cl (Gordon & MacPhail) Review

**Distillery:** Balblair  
**Bottler:** Gordon & MacPhail  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £22.92

Balblair, a Highland distillery with a history of crafting whisky since 1790, often flies under the radar compared to its more illustrious neighbours. However, this 10-year-old expression, bottled by the reputable Gordon & MacPhail, provides a window into the distillery's soul at a price that won't break the bank.

Upon first glance, the packaging is classic and understated, letting you know that what's inside is more important than a flashy exterior. The 35cl bottle size is a nice touch for those looking to explore without committing to a full bottle.

### First Impressions

The aroma is inviting, with hints of green apples, honey, and a gentle oakiness that promises a classic Highland experience. It's the kind of scent that beckons you to a comfortable chair by the fireplace.

### Flavour Profile

Taking a sip, the 43% ABV offers a warm welcome without overpowering. You're greeted with a sweetness reminiscent of vanilla and toffee, followed by a subtle fruitiness that keeps things interesting. As you let it linger, a soft spice dances on the palate, adding depth to the experience.

Balblair 10 Year Old is a whisky that doesn't try to be overly complex, but rather aims to be enjoyed. The balance of flavors is commendable, with each sip revealing a little more character.

### Value for Money

At just under £23 for a 350ml, this whisky punches above its weight in terms of value. It's a solid introduction to the brand and a neat way to taste the essence of the Highlands without splurging on a full bottle.

### Comparisons

If you're a fan of Glenmorangie Original or perhaps the Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old but are looking to explore something slightly different without veering off the beaten path, this Balblair expression could be your next favourite.

### Brand and Distillery

Balblair's approach to whisky making is all about timing. They only release their whisky when it's ready, not just when it reaches a certain age. This 10-year-old offering by Gordon & MacPhail showcases the distillery's commitment to quality and character.

### Conclusion

Balblair 10 Year Old is a delightful sipper that's accessible to newcomers and appreciated by aficionados for its honest representation of Highland whisky. It's a bottle that invites you to slow down, pour another dram, and just enjoy the moment.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** A charming and unpretentious Highland whisky that offers good value for money. Its classic flavors are well-executed, and while it may not be the most complex dram, it is certainly one to enjoy for its straightforward, pleasing character.
