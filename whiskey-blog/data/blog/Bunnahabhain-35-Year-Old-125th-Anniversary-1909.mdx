        # Bunnahabhain 35 Year Old 125th Anniversary Review

**ABV:** 44.9%  
**Price:** $1999

Whisky enthusiasts, gather around as we delve into the world of a distinguished veteran: the Bunnahabhain 35 Year Old 125th Anniversary edition. A special release from the Islay-based Bunnahabhain distillery, this dram is not just a sip of whisky; it's a sip of history.

### First Impressions

Upon first glance, the packaging speaks volumes of its heritage — a nod to the distillery's long-standing tradition. Cradling the bottle, you feel the weight of its age, and if you're like me, there's a flutter of excitement at the prospect of tasting something that's been maturing for as long as some of us have been alive.

### On the Nose

The aroma is a complex bouquet that invites you to a dance of scents. There's no aggressive alcohol burn, which is sometimes present in younger spirits. Instead, you're met with a mature, mellow richness. Think ripe fruits mingling with a gentle, oaky spice, and perhaps a whisper of the sea breeze that Islay whiskies are renowned for.

### The Palate

As for the flavor, it's an exquisite tapestry of tastes. The 35 years of aging have certainly done their work, imparting layers upon layers of depth. There's a delightful sweetness reminiscent of dried fruits and honey, balanced by a subtle nuttiness and the characteristic Bunnahabhain maritime saltiness. The finish? Long, warming, and satisfyingly complex, leaving you with a gentle smokiness that lingers just long enough.

### Value for Money

Now, let's talk money. At $1999, this is certainly an investment. Is it good value? For a special release of this age and caliber, I'd argue it is — if you're in the market for such a luxury. It's not your everyday dram but rather a collector's piece or a celebratory bottle.

### Comparable Whiskies

In terms of similar whiskies, you might look towards other aged Islay expressions like the Laphroaig 30 or the Bowmore 30. While each has its unique profile, they share that sense of time-enriched complexity that comes with decades in the cask.

### The Distillery

Bunnahabhain has a reputation for producing some of the more approachable Islay whiskies, often less peaty and more nuanced. This 125th Anniversary edition is a testament to their craft, a true masterpiece from a distillery that prides itself on its gentle touch with the robust Islay character.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Bunnahabhain 35 Year Old 125th Anniversary is a dram that commands respect. It's a celebration of time, tradition, and the art of whisky-making. For the connoisseur, it's a must-try, and for the collector, it's a must-have.

**Rating:** 4.5/5  
**Summary:** This Bunnahabhain release is exceptional — a well-aged, beautifully complex whisky that captures the essence of Islay without overwhelming the senses. While the price tag is steep, it reflects the rarity and craftsmanship of this special edition. For those with the means, it's an indulgence that is sure to provide a memorable experience.
