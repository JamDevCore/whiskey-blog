        # Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon Review

**Brand:** Four Roses  
**Price:** £29.57  
**ABV:** 45% (90 Proof)

Four Roses is a name that resonates with bourbon lovers far and wide, known for its history and distinctive approach to bourbon-making. Their Small Batch Bourbon is no exception to their tradition of quality, but let's delve into the specifics to find out if it's as rosy as its reputation suggests.

## First Impressions

The presentation of Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon is straightforward and unpretentious. It doesn't scream for attention on the shelf, but its elegance is in its simplicity. The bottle design is classic, with the iconic rose bouquet emblem that signifies the brand's commitment to craftsmanship.

Upon uncorking the bottle, you're greeted with a warm, inviting aroma. There's a hint of oak, a dash of vanilla, and a subtle spice that tickles the nose. It's the kind of scent that promises a good, classic bourbon experience.

## Tasting Notes

Take a sip, and the first thing you'll notice is a well-rounded smoothness. The 45% ABV gives it a medium body that's not too heavy on the palate. The flavor profile is a harmonious blend of sweet and spicy. Rich caramel and ripe fruits come through at first, followed by a rye-induced spice that's sharp but not overwhelming.

The finish is pleasantly long, with a lingering warmth and a touch of that oak you smelled at the outset. It's smooth, with just enough burn to remind you that you're sipping a genuine Kentucky straight bourbon.

## Value for Money

At just under $30, Four Roses Small Batch is a solid purchase. It's an accessible bourbon that stands up well against competitors in its price range, such as Buffalo Trace or Elijah Craig Small Batch. This makes it a versatile choice for both sipping neat and mixing into your favorite cocktails.

## Brand and Bourbon Insights

Four Roses has a unique approach to bourbon-making, utilizing ten different recipes and two mash bills, which is quite uncommon in the industry. This Small Batch is a blend of four of these recipes, hence the name, which allows for a complex and balanced flavor profile that's both interesting and enjoyable.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're exploring around the same price point, you might also consider trying the Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select or the Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year. Both offer their own take on the small batch process and are excellent in their own rights.

## Final Thoughts

Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon is a testament to the brand's dedication to quality without the need for bells and whistles. It's a bourbon that's as comfortable at a backyard BBQ as it is in a leather-clad whiskey lounge.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon is a delightful sipper and a great introduction to the brand's extensive lineup. With a well-balanced flavor profile and a price that won't break the bank, it's a bourbon that deserves a spot on your shelf. It's not the most complex bourbon you'll ever taste, but it's reliable, enjoyable, and excellent for both new enthusiasts and seasoned bourbon drinkers alike.
