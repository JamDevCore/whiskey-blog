        # Littlemill 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Littlemill  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** Approx. $399

Littlemill Distillery has the prestige of being one of the oldest distilleries in Scotland before it sadly closed its doors in the early 1990s. The Littlemill 12 Year Old is a window into a bygone era of whisky-making, offering enthusiasts a chance to taste history.

### First Impressions

Upon opening the bottle, you're greeted with a welcoming bouquet that suggests a level of complexity that's intriguing for a whisky of this age. The packaging is simple yet elegant, reflecting the distillery's heritage without unnecessary frills.

### Flavour Profile

Taking the first sip, the Littlemill 12 Year Old presents a light and floral character, typical of a Lowland Scotch. It's a delicate dance of flavors with hints of fresh citrus, cut grass, and perhaps a touch of vanilla sweetness that comes through. The oak influence is gentle, allowing the spirit's natural character to shine without being overpowered.

The palate is rewarded with a smooth and refined experience. It's not a flavor bomb by any means, but rather a subtle and nuanced dram that demands attention and slow appreciation. The finish is medium in length, leaving behind a pleasant, slightly spicy aftertaste.

### Value for Money

At around $399, Littlemill 12 Year Old is certainly on the higher end of the price spectrum, largely due to its rarity. For collectors and enthusiasts who revel in tasting a piece of whisky history, the price may be justified. However, for casual drinkers looking to explore the world of whisky, there are more affordable expressions that offer a similar flavor profile.

### Comparable Whiskies

In terms of similar whiskies, one might look to Auchentoshan or Glenkinchie for that light and floral Lowland style. These distilleries produce accessible and often less expensive whiskies that still provide a taste of the region's quintessential character.

### Brand and History

The story of Littlemill is one of triumph and tragedy. Established in the 18th century, it survived through the centuries, only to be destroyed by fire post-closure. Bottles from Littlemill are a part of Scotch whisky history, and owning one is like having a piece of that legacy.

### Overall Experience

The Littlemill 12 Year Old is a gentle, refined whisky that serves as a testament to the distillery's craftsmanship. It's a dram to be savored slowly, preferably in a quiet moment where its subtleties can be fully appreciated.

### Rating: 3.5/5

**Summary:** Littlemill 12 Year Old is a treasure for whisky historians and enthusiasts alike, offering a glimpse into the past with its light and complex palate. While the price is steep and may deter some, for others, the opportunity to taste such a rare piece of whisky heritage is priceless.
