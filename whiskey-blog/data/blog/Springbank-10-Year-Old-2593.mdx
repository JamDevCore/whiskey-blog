        # Springbank 10 Year Old Review

**ABV:** 46%  
**Price:** Approximately Â£55

Nestled in the picturesque town of Campbeltown, once the whisky capital of the world, sits the Springbank Distillery - a name that resonates with whisky aficionados for its quality and traditional approach to whisky making. The Springbank 10 Year Old is a testament to this heritage, offering a dram that is both complex and approachable.

Upon first pour, the golden amber hue of the Springbank 10 suggests a welcoming warmth. The nose is a delightful prelude, with hints of sea salt, cut green apples, and a soft peat smoke that is characteristic of Springbank's gentle approach to peated whiskies.

Taking the first sip, the palate is greeted with a harmonious blend of flavors. There's a subtle sweetness reminiscent of honey and vanilla, balanced with a nuttiness and a slight maritime quality that nods to its coastal roots. The peat here is not overwhelming; instead, it's a whisper of smoke that intertwines with the other flavors, adding depth without dominating. The finish is long and satisfying, leaving a trace of spice and a lingering, comforting warmth.

For those considering value for money, the Springbank 10 Year Old presents a strong case. At around $55, it's positioned in a competitive spot where it outshines many in its age category, both in complexity and character. It's a whisky that both a newcomer and a seasoned drinker can appreciate, making it a smart addition to any collection.

In comparison to its peers, the Springbank 10 shares a stage with whiskies like the Talisker 10 Year Old, which also boasts a maritime influence and a touch of smoke. However, Springbank's offering is often noted for its unique, almost rustic character - a product of its traditional, hands-on production methods.

The Springbank Distillery is one of the few remaining family-owned distilleries in Scotland, and it's known for performing every step of the whisky production process on-site. This includes malting its own barley, using traditional worm tub condensers, and bottling the spirit without chill filtration or coloring. This dedication to craft is palpable in every sip of the Springbank 10.

In conclusion, the Springbank 10 Year Old is a whisky that truly encapsulates the spirit of Campbeltown. It's a dram that offers more than just a taste; it's a journey through a storied landscape of flavor and tradition.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Springbank 10 Year Old is an exceptional dram that punches above its weight in terms of flavor and complexity. With its balanced peat, maritime notes, and traditional craftsmanship, it's a whisky that will delight both the casual drinker and the connoisseur. At its price point, it's a compelling choice and a shining example of what makes Springbank a beloved name in the whisky world.
