        # Four Roses Bourbon Review

**Brand:** Four Roses  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** Â£26.26

Walking into the world of whiskey can be like stepping into a grand library â€“ each bottle a tome filled with stories and flavors. Today, I'm flipping through the pages of Four Roses Bourbon, a whiskey with a heritage that's as rich as its taste.

### First Impressions

Four Roses greets you with a classic bottle design that's as unassuming as it is iconic. It doesn't scream for attention on the shelf, but it does whisper of tradition. Upon uncorking the bottle, there's a welcoming bouquet of sweet corn, hints of apple, and a touch of oak that sets the stage for what's to come.

### The Flavor Journey

Take a sip, and the journey begins with a smooth, mellow start. It's not a flavor bomb that explodes on your palate but rather a gentle wave of caramel and vanilla that washes over you. There's a slight spiciness, reminiscent of rye bread, that tickles the tongue and adds depth to the experience. The finish is medium-long, leaving a warm, slightly sweet oakiness that invites you to take another sip.

### Value for Money

At just over $26, Four Roses Bourbon presents itself as a solid choice for both beginners and seasoned sippers. It's versatile enough for a neat pour, yet it doesn't break the bank if you decide to mix it into a cocktail. In the realm of bourbons at this price point, it's a commendable contender, often outshining its peers with its approachable complexity.

### Similar Whiskies

If you're looking to explore relatives of Four Roses, you might want to try Buffalo Trace or Wild Turkey 81. Both offer a comparable experience in terms of quality and price, though each with their unique twists and turns on the palate.

### The Story in the Bottle

Four Roses has a storied past, surviving the twists and turns of American history, including the Prohibition era. Today, it's known for a unique process of blending whiskeys from ten different recipes, which is somewhat of a rarity in the bourbon world. This meticulous craft is what gives Four Roses its consistent and recognizable profile.

### Approachability

Whether you're a newbie to the whiskey scene or have a well-worn spot at the bar, Four Roses Bourbon is an approachable drink. It doesn't intimidate with overly complex notes, nor does it disappoint with simplicity. It finds a sweet spot that makes it a reliable go-to for a casual evening sip.

### Final Thoughts and Rating
