        # Laphroaig 15 Year Old - 1990s Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** $499

Laphroaig, a name that resonates with peat lovers, offers an intriguing journey into the world of smoky whiskies. The Laphroaig 15 Year Old from the 1990s is a beacon of the brand's heritage, an older expression that has become a rare find on the shelves of whisky collectors.

## First Impressions

Unboxing the Laphroaig 15 Year Old is like stepping into a time machine. The packaging may carry the weight of decades, but it's the liquid gold inside that we're after. The first whiff is a familiar Laphroaig greeting: a robust and unmistakable peat smoke, but with a certain mellowness that age brings.

## Flavour Profile

Upon tasting, the 43% ABV is gentle on the palate, delivering a complex symphony of flavors. The peat is there, no doubt, but it's joined by a maritime salinity that speaks of its Islay roots. There's a sweetness reminiscent of toffee and ripe orchard fruits, perhaps a nod to the sherry casks that cradled this spirit for 15 years.

The finish is long and warming, with the smokiness lingering like the last embers of a campfire. It's this combination of earthy peat, subtle sweetness, and ocean spray that makes Laphroaig 15 Year Old a standout dram.

## Value for Money

At $499, this whisky is certainly an investment. However, considering its age, discontinued status, and the rich experience it offers, it could be justified for the right enthusiast. It's a piece of Laphroaig's history, after all.

## Comparable Whiskies

For those looking for alternatives, consider the Laphroaig 10 Year Cask Strength for a more intense peat punch, or the Lagavulin 16 Year Old for a similar aged Islay profile. Both offer a peek into the world of smoky whiskies at a lower price point.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

Laphroaig has a storied past, with its distillery on the shores of Islay since 1815. Known for their full-bodied and smoky whiskies, they've garnered a fan base that appreciates the unabashedly bold flavors. Owning a bottle from the 1990s is not just a treat for the senses, but a nod to the brand's enduring craftsmanship.

## Conclusion

**Rating:** 4.5/5

In summary, Laphroaig 15 Year Old - 1990s is a beautifully aged Islay whisky that will delight those who cherish peaty drams.
