        # Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £18.54

Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky is a staple on many a liquor shelf, known for its affordability and reliable taste. It's a blend that doesn't pretend to be the most complex or prestigious, but instead offers a comfortable and familiar experience for both whisky newcomers and those looking for a casual dram.

### First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Famous Grouse bottle doesn't scream luxury, but its label, featuring the iconic red grouse, is recognizable and reassuring. The whisky itself has a golden amber color, suggesting a welcoming warmth before you've even taken the first sip.

### Flavor Profile

On the nose, you're greeted with a blend of soft fruit notes, a hint of spice, and a whiff of oak. It's not an aroma that will knock your socks off, but it's pleasant and inviting.

Taking a sip, the flavor is straightforward. There's a sweetness there, reminiscent of caramel and ripe fruits, balanced with a touch of oak and a mild peatiness that adds a bit of Scottish character. The finish is short to medium, leaving a slightly spicy and dry aftertaste that doesn't overstay its welcome.

### Value for Money

At just under £20, Famous Grouse offers good value for money. It's a blend that can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or as the base of a cocktail without feeling like you're compromising on taste or quality. For those looking to explore Scotch without a hefty price tag, this is a solid starting point.

### Similar Whiskies

If you're a fan of Famous Grouse and are looking to branch out, you might consider trying Johnnie Walker Black Label for a bit more complexity, or Teacher's Highland Cream for a similar price point with a slightly different flavor profile.

### The Brand and Its Legacy

The Famous Grouse has been around since 1896 and has become Scotland's most popular blended whisky. It's a testament to the brand's consistency and understanding of its audience. While it won't be the crown jewel of a whisky connoisseur's collection, it's often the go-to for a reliable and accessible Scotch experience.

### Final Thoughts

Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It's a straightforward, no-frills blend that delivers on its promise of a decent Scotch at an affordable price. It's the kind of whisky that's perfect for a casual evening with friends or a relaxing night in.

**Rating:** 3/5  
**Summary:** Famous Grouse is your dependable friend in the world of Scotch whisky. It offers a simple yet satisfying experience that won't break the bank. It's not a showstopper, but it's not trying to be—and that's perfectly okay.
