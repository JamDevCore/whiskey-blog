        # Mortlach 15 Year Old 35cl (Gordon & MacPhail) Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £26.4 for 35cl

Stepping into the world of Mortlach, we're greeted by the Mortlach 15 Year Old, a half-bottle offering from the reputable independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail. For those who may not know, Mortlach is a distillery with a bit of a cult following, thanks to its robust and meaty character, often referred to as 'The Beast of Dufftown.' But don't let that nickname scare you off—this whisky has a lot to offer.

**First Impressions:**  
The Mortlach 15 Year Old comes in a smaller 35cl bottle, which is a nice option for those looking to explore without committing to a full-size bottle. The packaging is simple and classic, hinting at the traditional methods behind this spirit.

**Flavour:**  
Upon nosing, you're likely to catch whiffs of dried fruit, perhaps a hint of plum or raisin, and a touch of warm spice. There's also a notable richness that's almost savory, a signature of Mortlach's distillation process.

Taking the first sip, the complexity unfolds with layers of dark chocolate, nutmeg, and leather, along with a subtle undertone of sweetness, like stewed fruit or a well-aged port. The finish is long and lingering, with a pleasant warmth and a slight drying effect that invites another sip.

**Value for Money:**  
Given the price point, this Mortlach is a steal. It's a great introduction to the distillery's profile, and the quality you're getting for a 15-year-old whisky at this price is commendable. It's also a fantastic option for those who appreciate a whisky with a rich, full-bodied flavor without the punch of cask strength.

**Similar Whiskies:**  
If you enjoy the Mortlach 15 Year Old, you might also appreciate whiskies like the GlenDronach 12 Year Old or the Aberlour 12 Year Old, both of which offer that delightful sherry cask influence and comparable depth.

**The Brand:**  
Gordon & MacPhail is known for their careful cask selection and maturation process, and they've done a fine job with this Mortlach. They have a knack for bringing out the best in the whiskies they bottle, and this one is no exception.

**Final Thoughts:**  
The Mortlach 15 Year Old by Gordon & MacPhail is a fine example of what Mortlach distillery can produce. It's a whisky that will appeal to both newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts looking for something with a bit of heft and complexity. It's approachable yet intricate, and most importantly, it's enjoyable.

**Rating:** 4/5  
A delightful dram that offers complexity and depth at a reasonable price. It's not the holy grail of whiskies, but it's a solid and satisfying experience that's well worth your time and money.
