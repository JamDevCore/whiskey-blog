        # Dalmore King Alexander III Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £266.53

The Dalmore King Alexander III is not just a whisky; it's a tapestry of flavors woven together to create a regal experience. Upon first glance, you're greeted with a bottle and packaging that exude luxury, hinting at the craftsmanship that lies within.

## First Impressions

The mahogany hue of this spirit suggests a rich and deep flavor profile. The bottle, with its distinctive stag emblem, sets the stage for a whisky that promises complexity and prestige.

## Flavor Journey

Upon the first sip, the Dalmore King Alexander III reveals a symphony of flavors. It's like an orchestra where each note is a different cask influence, all playing in harmony. You can expect a palate that dances between sweet and savory notes: ripe berries, a hint of citrus zest, and the warm embrace of vanilla and caramel. The chocolate and nutty undertones are subtle, but they add a layer of depth that makes each sip a discovery.

## Value Proposition

At a glance, the price tag may raise eyebrows, but this is not your everyday dram. It's a collector's choice, a celebration whisky. When you consider the six different cask finishes that contribute to its profile – including ex-bourbon, Matusalem oloroso sherry, Madeira, Marsala, port, and Cabernet Sauvignon – the price begins to make sense. You're not just buying a bottle; you're investing in an experience.

## Comparable Whiskies

For those who appreciate the craftsmanship of multiple cask finishes, whiskies like Glenmorangie Signet or the Balvenie PortWood 21 Year Old may come to mind. These also offer complex, layered experiences but at a different price point and with their own unique twists.

## The Dalmore Legacy

The Dalmore brand is synonymous with luxury and a commitment to the art of whisky making. With over 180 years of heritage, the distillery has a reputation for creating exceptional single malt whiskies. The King Alexander III is a testament to their masterful blending and maturation prowess.

## Approachability

Whether you're a seasoned whisky aficionado or a curious newcomer, the Dalmore King Alexander III is approachable with its 40% ABV. It's smooth enough for those new to the spirit and intricate enough for the connoisseurs to appreciate.

## Final Thoughts and Rating

**Rating:** 4.5/5

The Dalmore King Alexander III is an exquisite whisky that commands respect. While the price is on the higher side, the unique combination of cask influences justifies the investment for those looking to indulge in a luxurious sip. It falls just short of perfection due to its lower ABV, which may leave some enthusiasts wishing for a little more punch to carry the flavors. Nevertheless, it's a masterclass in blending that delivers a memorable and enjoyable experience.

In conclusion, if your wallet allows, the Dalmore King Alexander III is a worthy addition to any collection, offering a taste of elegance and the art of whisky craftsmanship.
