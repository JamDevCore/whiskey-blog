**Distillery**: Auchentoshan  
**ABV**: 40%  
**Age**: 12 Years  
**Price**: $35.95

## First Impressions

Auchentoshan, often referred to as "Glasgow's Malt Whisky" due to its proximity to the city, has a reputation for a unique triple distillation process, which isn't common in Scotland. The 12 Year Old is a step into the distillery's core range, and the bottle design is quite inviting with its clean lines and straightforward labeling.

## Flavor Profile

Upon first nosing, you're greeted with a bouquet of citrus zest, ripe green apples, and a hint of toasted almond. It's fresh, it's clean, and there's an underlying layer of vanilla sweetness that beckons you to take that first sip.

Upon tasting, the Auchentoshan 12 does not disappoint. The palate is light yet has a nice oily texture, a hallmark of its triple distillation. It's like a gentle waltz of flavors on the tongue, with notes of lemon curd, a drizzle of honey, and a whisper of oak spice. The finish is short to medium, leaving a pleasant warmth with a touch of ginger and a residual sweetness.

## Value for Money

At just under $36, this whisky offers a solid experience for its price point. It's not going to break the bank and it's definitely a step up from the entry-level offerings. For those looking to explore the Lowland style without a hefty investment, Auchentoshan 12 Year Old is a good value.

## Similar Whiskies

If you're a fan of the light, floral character found in Lowland whiskies, Glenkinchie 12 might be another bottle to consider. It's in a similar price bracket and offers that gentle, grassy profile that's characteristic of the region.

## The Brand and Its Charm

Auchentoshan prides itself on being accessible and approachable, and this 12 Year Old expression embodies that spirit. The distillery's dedication to triple distillation is said to create a smoother spirit, and it's evident in this whisky.

## Final Thoughts

The Auchentoshan 12 Year Old is a delightful dram, particularly for those who appreciate a lighter, more delicate whisky. It's a great introduction to the Lowland style and a bottle that can be enjoyed by both newcomers and seasoned whisky drinkers alike.

**Rating**: 4/5
