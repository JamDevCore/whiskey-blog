        # Aberfeldy 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Aberfeldy  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £42.05

Welcome to a casual stroll through the Highlands with the Aberfeldy 12 Year Old. This golden dram has a reputation for being a centerpiece in the Dewar’s blend, but it stands quite tall on its own, too. Let's dive into what makes this whisky a charming sipper.

## First Impressions

Right out of the bottle, the Aberfeldy 12 greets you with a warm, golden hue that promises a classic Scotch experience. The packaging is straightforward, yet elegant, suggesting a whisky that respects tradition without being overly flashy.

## The Flavor Journey

Upon nosing the whisky, you'll find a delightful mix of honey, slight citrus, and a whisper of vanilla – it's like being invited into a cozy, well-kept cottage. The first sip confirms the nose's promise, delivering a smooth, malty sweetness complemented by a touch of spice and a nutty undertone. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel; it's just good, honest whisky.

Mid-palate, the Aberfeldy 12 shows its more sophisticated side, with a subtle oakiness and a hint of smoke that doesn’t overpower the initial sweetness. The finish is medium-length, leaving you with a lingering warmth and a desire to revisit the glass.

## Value for Money

At a little over £40, Aberfeldy 12 Year Old presents itself as a solid value proposition. It's not the cheapest single malt on the shelf, but it's far from the priciest. For a well-aged whisky with a dependable flavor profile, the price feels just right.

## Comparisons

When considering similar whiskies, you might look at the Glenfiddich 12 or the Glenmorangie 10. Both offer that approachable, Highland style but with their own unique twists. Aberfeldy 12 sits comfortably among these as a competitor, especially for those who favor a bit more honey and heft in their dram.

## Behind the Bottle

Aberfeldy Distillery, nestled in the central Highlands of Scotland, is known for its use of water from the Pitilie Burn – reputed to have gold in its waters. This might just add a little extra magic to the whisky-making process. The distillery itself has been around since the late 19th century, and its heritage is felt in every sip of their carefully crafted spirit.

## The Verdict

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Aberfeldy 12 Year Old is a reliable, comforting single malt that offers a taste of the Highlands without any pretense. It's well-balanced, with a honeyed sweetness that makes it accessible to beginners while still engaging enough for the seasoned whisky drinker. For its price, it's a bottle that you can confidently bring to a gathering or enjoy quietly by the fireside. A solid 4 out of 5 – not quite perfection, but a very good friend in the whisky world.
