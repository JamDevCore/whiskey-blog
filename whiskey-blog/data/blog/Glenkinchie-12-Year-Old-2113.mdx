        # Glenkinchie 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Glenkinchie  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** $40.85

Nestled in the rolling farmlands of East Lothian, Glenkinchie distillery offers us the Glenkinchie 12 Year Old, a classic Lowland single malt Scotch whisky. Known as "The Edinburgh Malt," this whisky serves as a gentle introduction to the world of Scotch for novices while still managing to hold a soft spot in the hearts of seasoned aficionados.

### First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Glenkinchie 12 Year Old presents itself in an unassuming bottle that whispers rather than shouts. The golden hue of the whisky is inviting, suggesting a lightness that is characteristic of Lowland whiskies. The aroma beckons with fresh, floral notes, a hint of cut grass, and a whisper of sweet lemon zest.

### On the Palate

Taking a sip, the initial flavour is crisp and clean, with a malty sweetness that's akin to biting into a freshly baked biscuit. There's a subtle complexity hereâ€”a little drizzle of honey, a sprinkle of toasted almonds, and a faint echo of green apples. The finish is dry and refreshing, leaving a trace of oak and a lingering warmth that's neither too aggressive nor too timid.

### Value for Money

Priced at just over $40, Glenkinchie 12 Year Old stands as a solid investment for both newcomers to Scotch and those looking for an everyday dram. It's not going to break the bank, and it delivers a quality and refinement that outpaces many in its price bracket.

### Comparable Whiskies

Those who enjoy Glenkinchie 12 might also appreciate the likes of Auchentoshan 12 or Dalwhinnie 15, both of which offer a similar approachability and gentle character. While each has its own unique profile, they share that inherent drinkability that makes them perfect for sipping on a relaxed afternoon.

### The Distillery & Brand

Glenkinchie distillery, one of the few remaining Lowland distilleries, has a history dating back to 1825. It has survived the test of time by sticking to traditional methods and maintaining a high standard for its small but well-crafted range of whiskies.

### Final Thoughts

The Glenkinchie 12 Year Old is a whisky that doesn't demand your attention so much as it politely invites you to sit down and get to know it better. It's a dram that's easy to appreciate, with enough nuance to keep the experience interesting.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Glenkinchie 12 Year Old is a delightful Lowland single malt that offers a fresh, crisp profile with a touch of sweetness and a dry finish. It's a great value for those seeking a gentle introduction to Scotch or just a pleasant, no-fuss sipper. While it may not be the most complex whisky on the shelf, it's a reliable and enjoyable companion, making it a solid addition to any collection.
