        # Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Knob Creek  
**ABV:** 50%  
**Price:** Â£37.55  

Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year Old straddles the line between the everyday sipper and the special occasion dram. Its robust 50% ABV suggests it's not messing around, and yet the price tag keeps it firmly in the realm of the accessible. 

Upon first pour, the deep amber hue catches the light, beckoning for a closer look. The nose is greeted with a hearty blast of vanilla, oak, and a whiff of caramel - it's like stumbling into a candy shop where the confectioner also happens to be a master carpenter.

Sipping Knob Creek is like taking a bite out of Kentucky itself. There's a boldness to the flavor, with charred oak and spice at the forefront, followed by a wave of sweetness reminiscent of burnt sugar and ripe stone fruits. The finish lingers, warm and slightly drying, with a peppery kick that reminds you of its potency.

Is it good value for money? Absolutely. This is a whiskey that punches above its weight, offering complexities that can go toe-to-toe with bottles that have a heftier price tag. It's a small batch bourbon that holds its own, whether neat, with a splash of water, or as the backbone of a whiskey-forward cocktail like an Old Fashioned.

For those looking for similar experiences, you might compare it to Eagle Rare 10 Year Old for its age statement and depth, or perhaps Bulleit Bourbon for its high rye content and spicy kick. Yet, Knob Creek has its own identity - one of no-nonsense quality that's been a staple of the brand since its inception in 1992.

The brand itself, part of the Jim Beam family and under the larger Beam Suntory umbrella, has a reputation for crafting quality bourbons that honor tradition while still appealing to modern palates. Knob Creek does this beautifully, capturing the essence of Kentucky's storied distilling history in each bottle.

In summary, Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year Old is a solid choice for both newcomers to the whiskey world and seasoned aficionados. It's straightforward yet nuanced, powerful yet approachable, and most importantly, it's a darn good bourbon at a fair price.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year Old delivers a robust and flavorful bourbon experience that exceeds expectations for its price point. With a well-balanced profile of sweetness, spice, and oak, it's versatile and thoroughly enjoyable, making it a staple for any whiskey lover's shelf.
