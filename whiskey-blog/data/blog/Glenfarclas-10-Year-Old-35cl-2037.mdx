        # Glenfarclas 10 Year Old 35cl Whisky Review

## Basic Information

- **Name:** Glenfarclas 10 Year Old 35cl
- **Brand:** Glenfarclas
- **Price:** £19.13 (price may vary depending on the retailer)
- **ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

Glenfarclas is a name that often evokes a sense of tradition and quality in the whisky world. The 10 Year Old, presented in a charming 35cl bottle, is no exception. It's a Speyside single malt, and Speyside is known for producing whiskies that are generally smooth and mellow, often with a fruity character. The bottle's size makes it a fantastic gift or a nice way to sample the Glenfarclas range without committing to a full bottle.

## Tasting Notes

Upon pouring, the golden amber color catches the eye, hinting at the decade it has spent maturing. The aroma is inviting, with a mix of sweet fruit notes like apples and pears, coupled with a subtle hint of malt and a whiff of oak.

Taking a sip, the Glenfarclas 10 Year Old greets you with a straightforward and approachable flavor profile. There's a sweetness reminiscent of sherry, as Glenfarclas is known for maturing their whisky in sherry casks. The palate is graced with a smooth, malty taste, complemented by a touch of nuttiness and a whisper of spice. The finish is moderately long, warm, and leaves a pleasant, slightly smoky aftertaste.

## Value for Money

Priced at a little over £19 for a 35cl bottle, this whisky offers a good introduction to the Glenfarclas range without breaking the bank. It's a solid representation of a Speyside malt and is a good value for those looking to explore this style of whisky.

## Comparison and Brand Info

Glenfarclas has a reputation for producing high-quality sherried whiskies, and the 10 Year Old is a good starting point. It's less complex than its older siblings, like the Glenfarclas 15 or 21, but it's also more accessible in terms of both price and flavor. It can be compared to other entry-level Speyside malts such as the Macallan 10 or the Balvenie DoubleWood 12, which also showcase the influence of sherry cask maturation.

Glenfarclas is a family-owned distillery, which in this era of corporate-owned entities, adds a layer of charm and authenticity to their brand. They have been distilling since 1836, and their experience shows in the craftsmanship of their whisky.

## Conclusion and Rating

**Rating:** 4/5

The Glenfarclas 10 Year Old 35cl is a delightful dram that serves as a great introduction to both the brand and Speyside whiskies. It's smooth, sweet, and easy to enjoy, making it suitable for both newcomers and seasoned whisky drinkers. While it may not be the most complex single malt out there, its charm lies in its simplicity and the quality it delivers at its price point. If you're looking for a reliable, everyday whisky or a thoughtful gift, this Glenfarclas is a solid choice.
