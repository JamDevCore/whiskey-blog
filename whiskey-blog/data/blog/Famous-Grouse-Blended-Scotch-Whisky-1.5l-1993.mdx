        # Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky Review

**Brand:** Famous Grouse  
**Price:** £39.84 for 1.5l  
**ABV:** 40%

The Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky is a familiar sight on many a liquor shelf, known for its accessibility and reliable quality for its price point. Let's dive into what makes this dram tick.

### First Impressions

The bottle design of Famous Grouse is straightforward, no-nonsense, and easily recognizable with its namesake bird adorning the label. Popping the cork, you're greeted with an aroma that's a blend of sweet, fruity notes with a hint of spice. It's not a nose that will knock your socks off, but it's inviting enough to encourage that first sip.

### Flavor and Experience

On the palate, Famous Grouse presents a smooth and mellow experience. You can expect a mix of vanilla, a touch of oak, and a whisper of peat. The sweetness is balanced, not overly pronounced, and the finish is medium, leaving a slightly warm and spicy taste that lingers just enough to remind you to take another sip. It's not complex, but it's comfortable, like an old armchair.

### Value for Money

At just under £40 for a 1.5l bottle, you're getting a decent amount of whisky for your buck. It's not the richest or most nuanced Scotch out there, but it's a solid choice for everyday sipping or for mixing into cocktails without feeling guilty about the price tag.

### Comparisons and Brand Info

Famous Grouse is up against other household names like Johnnie Walker Red Label or Dewar's White Label. It holds its own in that category, offering a similar level of quality and taste profile. The brand itself has been around since 1896 and has built a reputation for consistency and affordability, which is no small feat in the whisky world.

### Summary

Famous Grouse is the epitome of an everyday Scotch. It won't challenge your taste buds with complexity, but it's a reliable choice for a casual drink after work or for sharing with friends who might not be whisky aficionados. It's approachable, easy to drink, and won't break the bank.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Summary:** Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky is your go-to for a straightforward, quaffable dram that offers good value for money. It's not going to redefine your understanding of Scotch, but it's dependable and enjoyable enough to keep in your rotation.
