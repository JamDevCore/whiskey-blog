        # Mortlach 16 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £299

Walking into the world of Mortlach is like stepping into a hidden glen, one with a reputation for producing a "beast" of a whisky, rich and robust. The 16 Year Old expression from Mortlach's Flora and Fauna series carries this bold legacy with a certain elegance that belies its beastly nickname.

## First Impressions

The bottle design is classic, unassuming, yet it conveys a sense of tradition. As you pour the deep amber liquid, the light catches it just right, hinting at the complexity to come. The scent wafts up, and you're greeted with rich, fruity notes, whispers of dark chocolate, and a woody backbone that promises depth.

## The Flavour Journey

Upon the first sip, the 43% ABV offers a gentle warmth rather than an overpowering burn. It's smooth on the palate, opening with a dance of dried fruits - think raisins and plums - that weave seamlessly into a tapestry of malty sweetness. The mid-palate transitions into spicier territory, with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon that add a festive touch.

The finish is where Mortlach's muscular reputation flexes. It's long, with a pleasant dryness and a lingering note of oaky vanilla that encourages contemplation. The meaty, almost savory undertone that Mortlach is known for makes a subtle appearance, rounding out the experience.

## Value for Money

At £299, the Mortlach 16 Year Old isn't an everyday dram for most, but it offers a unique experience that justifies its price tag. It's a whisky that commands attention and savoring, ideal for special occasions or as a gift for the discerning whisky lover.

## Similar Whiskies

If you're on the hunt for similar profiles, consider whiskies like the GlenDronach 15 Year Old Revival or the Dalmore 15 Year Old. Both offer rich, sherry-influenced flavors that can stand in the same ring as Mortlach.

## The Mortlach Distillery and Its Legacy

Mortlach, known for its "2.81 times" distillation process, is often regarded as a cult favorite among whisky aficionados. This unique method contributes to the complexity and full-bodied character of their whiskies. The Flora and Fauna series itself is a nod to the biodiversity of Scotland, adding a touch of romanticism to the Mortlach range.

## Conclusion

The Mortlach 16 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a whisky with character and depth, a true reflection of its Speyside roots and the rich history of the distillery. While not the most accessible due to its price, it stands as a testament to craftsmanship and tradition in the whisky world.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** A whisky of distinction and complexity, the Mortlach 16 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a delightful dram with a price that matches its quality. It may not be for everyday enjoyment, but for those special moments, it delivers an experience that lingers both on the palate and in the memory.
