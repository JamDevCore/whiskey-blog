        # Lagavulin 16 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Lagavulin  
**Age:** 16 Years Old  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £75.87

Lagavulin, a name that resonates with peat lovers, hails from the smoky shores of Islay. The Lagavulin 16 Year Old is a staple for those who adore the rich, peated whiskies that the island is renowned for. Let's delve into this classic dram and see what makes it a favorite in the whisky community.

Upon first pour, the deep amber hue of the whisky suggests a certain depth that awaits. The aroma that wafts from the glass is a complex tapestry of peat smoke, maritime saltiness, and a sweetness reminiscent of dried fruit. This is a nose that beckons you to take that first sip, promising a journey of flavor.

And what a journey it is. On the palate, the Lagavulin 16 does not disappoint. The peat is assertive but not overpowering, allowing room for a symphony of flavors to come through. There's a harmonious blend of dark chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and a whisper of citrus zest that cuts through the smoke. It's like a campfire by the ocean, with the smoke mingling with the briny sea air. The finish is long, warm, and satisfying, with the smoke lingering like the last embers of that seaside campfire.

Is it good value for money? Absolutely. For a 16-year-old single malt of this caliber, the price is more than fair. It's a whisky that delivers on all fronts, and while there are certainly cheaper options available, few can match the depth and character of Lagavulin 16.

In terms of similar whiskies, you might consider the Ardbeg 10 Year Old or the Laphroaig 10 Year Old for that peaty punch, though they lack the maturity and rounded profile of the Lagavulin. For those looking to explore within the same family, the Lagavulin 8 Year Old offers a younger, more vibrant take on the distillery's signature style.

Lagavulin as a brand is steeped in history, having been established in 1816. The distillery has a long-standing reputation for producing some of the finest peated whiskies, and the 16 Year Old is often seen as the quintessential expression of their craft.

In conclusion, the Lagavulin 16 Year Old is a whisky that commands respect. It's a dram that can be enjoyed by both the seasoned Islay fan and those new to the peated whisky scene. Whether you're savoring it by a warm fire or sharing it with friends, it's a bottle that's well worth its place on the shelf.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Lagavulin 16 Year Old is a beautifully balanced, richly peated single malt that delivers complexity and satisfaction. Its combination of smoky intensity and subtle sweetness makes it a standout dram, offering excellent value for its age and quality. Whether you're a peated whisky aficionado or a curious newcomer, this is one whisky that won't disappoint.
