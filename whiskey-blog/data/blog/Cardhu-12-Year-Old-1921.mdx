        # Cardhu 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Cardhu  
**Age:** 12 Years Old  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** $39.85

When you first encounter a bottle of Cardhu 12 Year Old, you're met with an elegant simplicity that seems to promise a classic Speyside experience. The price point sets this whisky in the accessible range, not too steep for a 12-year maturation, and that's a good start.

## First Impressions

Cracking open the bottle, the whisky greets you with a warm, golden hue, reminiscent of autumnal afternoons. It's a look that invites you to pour, sit back, and relax. The packaging is understated, classy, and in line with what you'd expect from a distillery that's been in the game since the 1800s.

## Flavour Notes

On the nose, Cardhu 12 is gentle, with hints of fresh fruit like apples and pears, alongside a whisper of honey and a touch of oak. It's not a dram that shouts; it speaks in soft, reassuring tones.

Taking a sip, the smoothness is apparent. It's medium-bodied with a balance of sweetness and a light smokiness that doesn't overpower. The palate follows the nose closely, with the fruitiness coming through and a dash of spice - perhaps cinnamon - that adds a bit of complexity.

The finish is moderate, leaving you with a lingering warmth and a slight nuttiness, which makes for a pleasant endnote. It's not a whisky that overstays its welcome, but rather, bows out gracefully.

## Value for Money

For under $40, Cardhu 12 offers good value. It's a solid, dependable Speyside single malt that delivers a satisfying experience without breaking the bank. It's not the most complex or challenging whisky, but that's not always what you're after.

## Comparisons and Brand Info

Cardhu is known for its approachable whiskies, and the 12 Year Old is a staple in their range. It's comparable to other Speyside offerings like the Glenfiddich 12 or the Glenlivet 12, which share a similar profile of fruit-forward and mellow drams.

What makes Cardhu interesting is its history, particularly the fact that it was founded by a woman, Helen Cumming, in an era when the industry was overwhelmingly male-dominated. It's a brand with a story, which adds a layer of depth to your drinking experience.

## Summary

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**In a Nutshell:** Cardhu 12 Year Old delivers a smooth, unpretentious, and enjoyable sip that's easy on the palate and the wallet. It's not going to turn the world upside down with innovation, but it's a fine example of a classic Speyside malt that's well worth having in your collection for those times when you just want a straightforward, tasty dram.

It's the kind of whisky that invites newcomers with open arms while still maintaining enough character to keep the regulars nodding in appreciation. A solid choice, indeed.
