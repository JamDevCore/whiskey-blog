        # Bowmore 12 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Bowmore  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** $39.74

Nestled on the shores of Loch Indaal on Islay, Bowmore distillery has a storied past dating back to 1779. It's one of the oldest in Scotland, and its offerings showcase a balance of peat and refinement. The Bowmore 12 Year Old is no exception, presenting a gateway into the world of Islay whiskies without overwhelming the palate.

### First Impressions

Upon opening the bottle, you're greeted with a subtle waft of smoke. The packaging of Bowmore 12 Year Old is classic and unassuming, hinting at the traditional methods employed by the distillery. The color, a warm amber, suggests a richness that beckons to be explored.

### Flavour Profile

The first sip reveals a symphony of flavors. There's the expected peatiness, but it doesn't overpower. Instead, it's a gentle brushstroke on a canvas of complex flavors. Notes of citrus and honey dance on the tongue, followed by a whisper of chocolate and sea salt. The finish is warm and lingering, with a hint of spice to remind you of its presence.

### Value for Money

At just under $40, Bowmore 12 Year Old sits comfortably in the "good value" category. It's a full-bodied experience that rivals some of its more expensive counterparts. For those who appreciate a smoky dram without the intensity of heavier Islay malts, it's a great pick.

### Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of the Bowmore 12, you might also enjoy the likes of Caol Ila 12 or Bunnahabhain 12, both of which offer that Islay character with their own unique twists. Caol Ila brings a bit more smoke to the table, while Bunnahabhain offers a sweeter, less peated profile.

### Interesting Tidbits

Bowmore's 12 Year Old is a reflection of its environment. The distillery's proximity to the sea is often credited for the slight saline quality in its whisky. It's also worth noting that Bowmore boasts one of the few remaining floor maltings in Scotland, keeping tradition alive and well.

### Who Should Try It?

This whisky is perfect for both newcomers to Islay malts and seasoned peat lovers looking for a daily sipper. It's approachable enough not to intimidate but has enough depth to satisfy the discerning drinker.

### Rating: 4/5

**Summary:** Bowmore 12 Year Old is a beautifully balanced Islay whisky that offers a taste of peat without the punch. It's an excellent value for money, and its complexity is sure to appeal to a wide range of whisky enthusiasts. While it may not reach the heights of perfection for every palate, its quality and character earn it a solid 4 out of 5. Whether you're cozying up by a fire or enjoying a quiet evening, Bowmore 12 is a companion that won't disappoint.
