Nestled at the foot of Dumgoyne hill, the Glengoyne distillery has been producing whisky with a reputation for a slow distillation process that promises a smooth dram. Their 10 Year Old expression is often seen as a gateway to the brand's range of Highland single malt whiskies.

Upon uncorking the bottle, there's an inviting whisper of fresh green apples and a hint of citrus. It's like being welcomed into an orchard in the early morning; there's a crispness that's refreshing and not overpowering.

Taking the first sip, the palate is greeted with a sweet melody of vanilla and honey, interlaced with the fruitiness that the nose hinted at. The oak influence is subtle, providing a warm background note that complements the sweetness rather than overshadowing it. The body is medium, not too oily nor too thin, which makes it quite approachable for both new enthusiasts and seasoned sippers.

For a 10-year-old, this whisky shows a maturity in flavor that you might expect from older expressions. However, it maintains a lightness that makes it suitable for a casual evening dram or as a gentle introduction to someone looking to explore the world of single malts.

In terms of value for money, Glengoyne 10 Year Old sits in a comfortable spot. It's not the cheapest on the shelf, but it's far from being considered overpriced. When compared to its peers, such as the Glenlivet 12 or Macallan 10, it holds its ground with a unique character that's worth the asking price.

A fun fact about Glengoyne – they pride themselves on not using peat in the drying of their malt, which allows the clean, natural flavors of the malt and water sourced from the Dumgoyne hill to shine through without the smoky characteristics found in some other Scotch whiskies.

In conclusion, the Glengoyne 10 Year Old is a solid, enjoyable whisky that offers a good balance of flavor and smoothness. It's a dram that doesn't demand too much from the drinker but offers enough complexity to be appreciated over time.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** Glengoyne 10 Year Old is a well-rounded and approachable single malt with a pleasant profile of fruits, vanilla, and a touch of oak. It's a dram that represents good value for money and can be enjoyed by novices and aficionados alike. While it may not be the most complex whisky on the market, its charm lies in its simplicity and clean taste.
