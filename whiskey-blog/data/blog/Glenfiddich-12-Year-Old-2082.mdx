        # Glenfiddich 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Glenfiddich  
**Age:** 12 Years Old  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £40.59

Glenfiddich, a name that resonates with many whisky lovers, is synonymous with quality and tradition. The 12-Year-Old expression is a staple in their lineup, often seen as a gateway into the world of single malts. Let's dive into what makes this Speyside whisky a constant favorite.

Upon first glance, the iconic triangular bottle of Glenfiddich 12 Year Old is both familiar and inviting. The golden liquid inside promises a classic Speyside experience, and it doesn't disappoint. The nose greets you with a bouquet of subtle fruit notes, think pear and apple, with a hint of oak lingering in the background.

Taking a sip, the smoothness is immediately apparent. The fruity notes detected on the nose carry through to the palate with a delightful richness. You'll also find a touch of malt and a whisper of sweetness, likely from the bourbon casks in which it's matured. The finish is modest yet satisfying, with a mild spiciness and a continued sweet note that rounds off the experience.

Now, talking about value for money, Glenfiddich 12 does a commendable job. At just over 40 bucks, it's priced competitively, especially considering its age statement and the brand's reputation. It's not the most complex dram you'll encounter, but its consistency and approachability make it a solid purchase.

When comparing it to other whiskies, Glenfiddich 12 sits comfortably with the likes of The Glenlivet 12 or even Macallan Double Cask 12 in terms of profile, albeit each with their own unique characteristics. It's a safe bet for someone new to whisky or for those looking to gift a reliable single malt without breaking the bank.

Glenfiddich itself is steeped in history, being one of the few single malt distilleries to remain family-owned. They've been crafting whisky since 1887, and their experience shows in the glass. The 12 Year Old is matured in a mix of Oloroso sherry and bourbon casks, giving it that balanced fruitiness and oak influence.

In conclusion, Glenfiddich 12 Year Old is like a comfortable pair of shoes; it may not stand out with flashy features, but it offers a dependable and enjoyable experience. It's the kind of whisky that invites you to relax and savor the moment, whether you're a seasoned drinker or just starting out.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** Glenfiddich 12 Year Old is a well-rounded, easy-drinking single malt that serves as a fantastic introduction to the world of whisky. It's not the most complex, but its consistency and pleasant flavor profile make it a great value for its price. It's a whisky that promises and delivers a true Speyside character, making it a reliable choice for any occasion.
