        # Inchgower 14 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**Brand:** Inchgower  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** $63.68

Inchgower may not be a household name for many whisky drinkers, but it's a brand with a character that deserves a bit of spotlight. Nestled in the Flora and Fauna series, the Inchgower 14 Year Old is a curious Speyside single malt with a bit of a coastal influence, not something you'd typically expect from the region.

## First Impressions

The packaging is straightforward, with the Flora and Fauna label showcasing various wildlife illustrations that add a touch of charm. The bottle itself is unassuming, letting you know that what's inside is more important than a flashy exterior. On uncorking, there is a waft of fruit and a hint of sea breeze, rather inviting for a first sniff.

## Flavor Profile

The first sip greets you with a delightful complexity. There's an initial sweetness reminiscent of ripe apples and pears, which is quickly followed by a subtle nuttiness. Think of a fruit salad tossed with a handful of almonds. Then comes the maritime twist â€“ a slight saltiness that plays well with the classic Speyside profile. It's not as pronounced as an Islay malt, but it's there, lurking in the background.

The oak influence is evident in the form of gentle spices, a result of 14 years of maturation. The finish is medium, leaving you with a pleasant dryness and a lingering taste of toffee and spice.

## Value for Money

At just over 60 bucks, Inchgower 14 Year Old sits at a sweet spot where it delivers more than what its price tag suggests. It's not the cheapest 14-year-old you'll find, but it's certainly not overpriced. For those who enjoy the complexity and the unique combination of fruity Speyside character with a coastal twist, this whisky offers good value for money.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're looking to explore similar profiles, you might want to try the Oban 14 Year Old, which also balances that Highland malt fruitiness with a touch of sea air. Alternatively, the Clynelish 14 Year Old offers a waxy, slightly maritime character that's quite enjoyable.

## The Brand and Its Charm

Inchgower is a bit of a hidden gem. The distillery, located near Buckie in Speyside, is known for producing malts that are commonly used in blends. This means that their single malts, like this one, can sometimes be overlooked. However, it's these under-the-radar labels that often surprise and delight whisky enthusiasts looking for something new.

## Final Thoughts

For whisky lovers who enjoy a dram with a twist, the Inchgower 14 Year Old is a compelling pour. It's not just another Speyside; it's a Speyside with a story, a touch of the sea, and a richness that unfolds beautifully in the glass.

**Rating: 4/5**

_Summary: Inchgower 14 Year Old - Flora and Fauna offers a delightful balance of fruity Speyside character with an unexpected coastal influence. It's a complex and engaging single malt that provides good value for its price. A solid choice for both seasoned enthusiasts and curious newcomers to the world of whisky._
