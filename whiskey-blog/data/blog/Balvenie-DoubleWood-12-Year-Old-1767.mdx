        # Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Balvenie  
**Price:** £49.22  
**ABV:** 40%

Today, we're delving into the world of Scotch whisky with the Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old. This Speyside classic has earned its reputation for being a solid, approachable single malt that's perfect for both newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts looking to enjoy a dram without breaking the bank.

## First Impressions

Right out of the bottle, you're greeted with the warm, inviting amber hue that promises a cozy experience. The packaging is classic and understated, much like the distillery itself, which has been a staple in the whisky world since 1892.

## Flavor Profile

On the nose, DoubleWood 12 offers a bouquet of sweet fruit and Oloroso sherry notes, layered with honey and vanilla. It's a gentle introduction that doesn't overpower but rather entices you to take that first sip.

Upon tasting, the sherry influence really comes to the forefront, showcasing the whisky's time spent maturing in two different types of wood – hence the name "DoubleWood." The first maturation is in traditional whiskey oak casks, which imparts smooth vanilla notes, while the second in European oak sherry casks adds richness and complexity with hints of spice and fruit.

The finish is pleasantly long and warming, with a mellow spiciness that lingers on the palate, reminding you of its 12 years spent carefully aging in the Speyside distillery's warehouses.

## Value for Money

At just a shade under £50, Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old is a great value. It's a versatile whisky that's complex enough for a special occasion but accessible enough for an everyday dram. It's in a similar price bracket as the Glenfiddich 12 or the Macallan Double Cask 12, both of which offer their own take on the sherry cask finish.

## The Balvenie Brand

Balvenie maintains a unique place in Scotch whisky history for its dedication to traditional craftsmanship. They're one of the few distilleries that still grow their own barley, use traditional floor maltings, and even have their own coppersmiths and coopers on site. This hands-on approach is definitely reflected in the quality of the whisky.

## Summary

In a market that's increasingly crowded with high-priced, no-age-statement offerings, the Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old stands out for its quality, consistency, and affordability. It's a beautifully balanced whisky that's sure to please a wide range of palates.

**Rating:** 4/5

The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old is a testament to the craft of whisky making. It's a solid, dependable single malt with just enough complexity to keep you coming back for more. Whether you're new to the world of Scotch or an old hand, this bottle offers great taste and great value, making it a welcome addition to any shelf.
