**Whisky Name:** Compass Box Hedonism  
**Brand:** Compass Box  
**Price:** £73.04  
**ABV:** 43%

## First Impressions

Compass Box Hedonism is an intriguing whisky that immediately catches the eye with its elegant bottle design, which hints at the refined experience that awaits within. The name "Hedonism" itself suggests a pursuit of pleasure, and the whisky doesn't disappoint. It's a blended grain Scotch, which is a bit of a rarity, as most blends focus on malt whiskies.

## Flavour Profile

The first sip of Compass Box Hedonism greets you with a velvety smoothness that's quite unexpected. It's like a gentle embrace of vanilla and caramel, with a whisper of coconut and perhaps a tease of citrus zest. The sweetness is not overpowering, and there's a delightful balance with a hint of oak and a touch of spice that dances on your palate. It's a symphony of subtlety – no single flavor outshines the others, but rather, they work in perfect harmony.

The medium finish leaves you with a warm, slightly spicy aftertaste that invites you to take another sip. It's not the boldest or the most complex whisky out there, but its elegance is in its restraint and balance.

## Value for Money

At around £73, Compass Box Hedonism isn't the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but it's far from the most expensive. For a whisky of this quality and uniqueness, it's reasonably priced. It's a great introduction to the world of grain Scotch whiskies, and it's versatile enough for both special occasions and a relaxed evening sipper.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're exploring similar whiskies, you might consider trying other premium blended grain whiskies, though they can be harder to find. In terms of character, you might enjoy the smoothness of a good quality Irish whiskey or perhaps a lighter single malt Scotch with a gentle profile.

## Brand and Whisky Info

Compass Box is a relatively new player in the Scotch whisky scene, having been founded in 2000 by John Glaser. They've quickly made a name for themselves with their innovative approach to blending and their commitment to transparency. Hedonism is a testament to their craft, showcasing the potential of grain whisky when given the same care and attention typically reserved for malt whisky.

## Final Thoughts and Rating

Compass Box Hedonism is a delightful dram that's sure to please those who appreciate a lighter, more nuanced whisky. It's got character and charm, without the need for a heavyweight punch. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes, less is more.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Compass Box Hedonism offers a beautifully balanced, smooth experience that's perfect for those seeking a grain whisky with character. It's a blend that's well worth its price, providing an elegant sip that's both satisfying and intriguing.
