**Age:** 12 Years Old  
**ABV:** 46.3%  
**Price:** $45.74

Welcome to the world of Deanston, where the whispers of the River Teith contribute to the making of a fine dram. Today, we're taking a look at the Deanston 12 Year Old, a Highland single malt that promises tradition and a touch of the unique.

## First Impressions

Upon uncorking the bottle, you're greeted with a warm, honeyed aroma. There's an inviting sweetness that suggests a comforting experience. It's like walking into a room with a wood fire crackling in the hearth. The presentation is straightforward and honest, much like the whisky itself.

## Flavour

Taking the first sip, the Deanston 12 Year Old does not disappoint. It's a melody of malty sweetness with a backing chorus of fruit and nuts. The initial taste is of fresh green apples and a hint of citrus, which then transitions into a more complex profile of vanilla and toffee. There's a pleasant oakiness that comes through, owing to the 12 years this whisky has spent maturing in former bourbon barrels.

The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly oily, coating the palate and allowing the flavors to linger, leading to a finish that is satisfyingly long with a whisper of spice. It's a bit like a warm, comforting blanket on a chilly evening.

## Value for Money

At around $45, Deanston 12 Year Old offers a solid experience. It's not the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but it's far from the priciest. For a whisky of this age and quality, you're getting good value for your money. It's a reliable choice for both a casual dram and a more introspective tasting session.

## Similar Whiskies

If you enjoy the Deanston 12, you might also appreciate the likes of Glenmorangie 10 Year Old or the Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old. These whiskies share a similar profile of being approachable, with a focus on clean and crisp flavors that don't overwhelm the palate.

## The Brand and Distillery

Deanston is a bit of a hidden gem among Scotch whisky distilleries. With a history that dates back to the 18th century, the building that houses Deanston Distillery began as a cotton mill before being converted in the 1960s. This heritage is reflected in the craft and care put into their whisky production. They're also known for their commitment to sustainability, using hydroelectric power to run their operations.

## Summary

The Deanston 12 Year Old is a solid, dependable whisky that offers a taste of the Highlands in a bottle. It's well-crafted, with a flavor profile that's complex enough to entertain but not so intricate that it becomes a puzzle. It's a whisky that's equally at home in a tumbler by the fireside or in a nosing glass at a tasting event.

**Rating:** 4/5  
**Summary:** Deanston 12 Year Old is a delightful sipper with a good balance of sweetness and oak. It's not going to turn the whisky world upside down, but it's a very enjoyable dram that delivers quality at a reasonable price point. If you're looking for an honest, no-frills Highland whisky, this bottle is certainly worth considering.
