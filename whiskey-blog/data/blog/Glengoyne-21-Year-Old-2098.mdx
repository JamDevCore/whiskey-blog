        # Glengoyne 21 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand:** Glengoyne  
**Age:** 21 Years  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £199.95

Stepping into the world of well-aged Scotch whiskies, we find ourselves savoring the Glengoyne 21 Year Old—a dram that whispers tales of tradition and patience. Upon first glance, the packaging exudes a sense of elegance, with the whisky's deep amber hue inviting a closer inspection.

### First Impressions

The initial nosing greets you with a rich tapestry of aromas. A harmonious blend of ripe fruits, notably apples and dried figs, dances with hints of toffee and a subtle oakiness that speaks of its two-decade slumber in oak casks. It's a welcoming introduction that sets the stage for the first sip.

### Flavour Exploration

On the palate, the Glengoyne 21 does not disappoint. The 43% ABV is gentle, making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts. It brings a delightful warmth rather than a burn, allowing the flavors to unfold gracefully. There's a complexity here, with notes of sherry from the cask maturation intermingling with vanilla, nutmeg, and a wisp of cinnamon spice. The finish is long, smooth, and satisfyingly sweet, with just enough tannic dryness to invite another sip.

### Value for Money

At just under £200, the Glengoyne 21 Year Old is positioned in a competitive space where expectations are high. It delivers an experience that is both luxurious and refined, making it a contender for good value, especially when compared to other 21-year-olds on the market. It's a whisky that could easily become a special occasion staple or a thoughtful gift for a whisky lover.

### Comparable Whiskies

Those who enjoy the Glengoyne 21 might also appreciate the likes of Glenfiddich 21 Year Old Reserva Rum Cask Finish or a Balvenie 21 PortWood, both of which share a similar age statement and exhibit that well-rounded, mature character with a unique cask influence.

### The Brand and Its Legacy

Glengoyne stands out for its commitment to unhurried production methods, including air-drying its barley, which is a departure from the more common practice of using peat smoke. This results in a purer, fruitier malt profile, which is a signature of the Glengoyne brand. The distillery's dedication to time-honored techniques contributes to the depth and smoothness found in this 21-year-old expression.

### Overall Rating: 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Glengoyne 21 Year Old is a testament to the beauty of time and tradition in whisky-making. Its rich, fruity character, combined with the depth of flavor from long-term maturation, makes it a distinguished and memorable dram. Its price reflects the quality and age, and it stands up well against its peers, offering a taste of luxury that doesn't disappoint. This whisky is certainly worth savoring, earning it a high rating of 4.5 out of 5. It's not just a drink; it's an experience—one that is sure to leave a lasting impression.
