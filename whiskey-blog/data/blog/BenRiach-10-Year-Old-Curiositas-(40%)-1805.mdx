        # BenRiach 10 Year Old Curiositas Review

- **Name:** BenRiach 10 Year Old Curiositas
- **Brand:** BenRiach
- **Price:** £37.33
- **ABV:** 40%

**First Impressions:**
Upon first glance, the BenRiach 10 Year Old Curiositas presents itself with an air of modesty yet intrigue. The packaging suggests a traditional approach, yet the name 'Curiositas' hints at something a little out of the ordinary. It's a Speyside single malt, which generally promises a certain level of quality and finesse.

**Flavour Profile:**
The first sip reveals the Curiositas' true nature: it’s a dance of peat on the palate, which is somewhat unexpected for a Speyside. The peat is not overwhelming but rather pleasantly woven into the fabric of this whisky's character. There are notes of apple, vanilla, and a touch of honey, all playing a supporting role to the earthy peat tones. The finish is medium, leaving a satisfying warmness with a whisper of spice.

**Value for Money:**
For a 10-year-old single malt Scotch whisky, priced at just over £37, the BenRiach Curiositas offers good value. It’s not often you find a peated Speyside at this price point, making it an interesting alternative for those looking to explore beyond the typical floral and fruit-forward profile of the region.

**Similar Whiskies:**
If you enjoy the Curiositas, you might also appreciate the likes of Ardmore Legacy or even the Balvenie Peat Week, though the latter tends to be pricier. These whiskies offer a similar surprise of peat in regions not typically known for smoky flavors.

**The Brand:**
BenRiach has a reputation for producing a diverse range of whiskies, often experimenting with different cask finishes and styles. This adventurous spirit is clearly reflected in the Curiositas, showcasing their willingness to break the mold of a typical Speyside whisky.

**Approachability:**
This whisky is approachable for both newcomers and seasoned drinkers. The peat level is just enough to give a taste of what a smoky whisky can offer without overwhelming the senses. It's a nice gateway for those curious about peated whiskies but not ready to dive into the deep end with something like an Islay.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:**
The BenRiach 10 Year Old Curiositas is a delightful twist on the classic Speyside character, offering a peaty profile that's well-balanced with traditional sweet and fruity notes. It's a solid choice for both peat lovers and those looking to expand their whisky horizons without breaking the bank. With its reasonable price and quality flavors, it earns a well-deserved 4 out of 5. It's not perfection, but it's a well-crafted dram that stands out for its uniqueness and value.
