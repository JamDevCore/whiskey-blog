        # Arran 10 Year Old Whisky Review

**Distillery:** Arran  
**Expression:** 10 Year Old  
**ABV:** 46%  
**Price:** £44.31

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Arran 10 Year Old has an inviting, golden hue that promises a classic Scotch experience. The branding is straightforward, with an emphasis on the whisky's Island heritage. There's an immediate sense of approachability, making it clear that this is a whisky meant to be enjoyed rather than dissected.

## Flavor Profile

As you pour the Arran 10 into your glass, the aroma gently wafts up, bringing notes of orchard fruits and a hint of vanilla. The initial sip confirms the nose, with a burst of green apples and ripe pears, followed by a subtle sweetness reminiscent of honey-drizzled barley. There's a delicate warmth that slowly builds, peppered with mild spice and a touch of citrus zest, rounding off the palate without overpowering it.

The finish is clean and moderately long, leaving behind a satisfying trail of those fruit notes and a whisper of oak from its 10 years spent maturing. What's particularly pleasant is the balance between the fruitiness and the malt, neither trying to outshine the other.

## Value for Money

At a mid-range price of £44.31, the Arran 10 Year Old presents itself as a solid contender in the value-for-money stakes. Its complexity is not overwhelming, making it a great daily dram or a welcoming introductory whisky for those new to the spirit. It stands up well against other whiskies in its price bracket, such as the Glenmorangie Original or the Highland Park 12 Year Old, offering a unique Island take on the 10-year age statement.

## Brand and Distillery

The Arran Distillery, located on the Isle of Arran, is known for its artisanal approach to whisky-making. The water used for the Arran whiskies comes from Loch na Davie, which is touted for its purity. The distillery prides itself on using traditional methods and non-chill filtered processes to preserve the natural flavors of their products. The 10 Year Old is a prime example of their craftsmanship, showcasing the character of the island's whisky without the influence of peat, which is often associated with Island drams.

## Overall Experience

The Arran 10 Year Old is like a refreshing breeze off the Scottish coast – invigorating yet soothing. It's an accessible whisky that doesn't demand too much from the drinker but offers enough depth for a seasoned palate to explore. It's a bottle that can comfortably sit on your shelf for any occasion, whether it's a casual evening with friends or a quiet night in.

## Rating: 4 out of 5

This Arran 10 Year Old earns a solid 4 out of 5. It's not quite the nirvana of whiskies, but it's an excellent dram that provides a pleasurable drinking experience. It's well-balanced, full of character, and priced within reach. Whether you're a newbie to the world of whisky or a well-versed enthusiast, the Arran 10 is a bottle that won't disappoint.

**Summary:** The Arran 10 Year Old is a testament to the beauty of simplicity in whisky. With its delightful balance of fruit and malt, it's a dram that's both uncomplicated and satisfying. The price point makes it a commendable choice for an everyday whisky, and its Island heritage adds a charming touch to the overall experience.
