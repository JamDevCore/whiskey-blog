        # Tomintoul 12 Year Old Oloroso Sherry Cask Review

**Brand:** Tomintoul  
**Price:** Â£57.87  
**ABV:** 40%

Whisky enthusiasts and casual sippers alike, let's dive into the Tomintoul 12 Year Old Oloroso Sherry Cask. Nestled in the heart of Scotland's Speyside region, Tomintoul is known as 'the gentle dram' due to its typically smooth and mellow character. This expression, matured in Oloroso sherry casks, promises an intriguing fusion of traditional Speyside sweetness with rich, fruity notes from the sherry wood.

### First Impressions

The bottle presents itself with an understated elegance, typical of Tomintoul's branding. Popping the cork, there's an inviting waft of dried fruits and a hint of nuttiness, characteristic of that sherry cask finish. The amber glow of the whisky is reminiscent of autumnal sunsets, and you can't help but anticipate that first sip.

### Flavour Profile

Upon tasting, the Oloroso influence is unmistakable. There's a delightful dance of sweet and spicy on the palate. You're first greeted with the classic Tomintoul smoothness, followed by a wave of raisins, sultanas, and a whisper of dark chocolate. The finish is where the sherry cask really sings, leaving a warm, slightly spicy, and lingering taste that invites another sip.

### Value for Money

Priced at just under $60, this Tomintoul offers good value for a 12-year-old single malt with a specialty cask finish. It's a solid choice for those looking to explore beyond the standard offerings without breaking the bank.

### Comparable Whiskies

If you enjoy the sherry cask finish, you might also appreciate whiskies like the GlenDronach 12 Year Old or the Glenfarclas 12 Year Old. Both offer that signature sherry sweetness and complexity, though they may come at a slightly higher price point.

### The Brand and Its Charm

Tomintoul has built a reputation for producing accessible, high-quality whiskies. This expression, with its sherry cask finish, adds a layer of sophistication to their range. It's a testament to the distillery's commitment to exploring different maturation processes while maintaining the core of what makes their whisky so approachable.

### Final Thoughts

The Tomintoul 12 Year Old Oloroso Sherry Cask is a delightful dram that showcases the harmony between Speyside spirit and sherry wood. It's a whisky that's easy to enjoy, whether you're a seasoned whisky drinker or just starting out on your whisky journey.
