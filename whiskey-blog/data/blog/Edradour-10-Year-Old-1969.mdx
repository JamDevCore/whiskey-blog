**Distillery:** Edradour  
**Age:** 10 Years Old  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £44.26

Nestled in the heart of Scotland's whisky region, Edradour holds the title of one of the smallest distilleries in the land. Their 10 Year Old expression is a testament to their craft, a whisky that has spent a decade maturing, gaining character and depth.

## First Impressions

The Edradour 10 Year Old arrives in a bottle that speaks to tradition, with its label bearing a classic design. It's the kind of whisky that promises a journey back in time, to the very roots of Scottish whisky-making. Popping the cork, you're greeted with a warm, inviting aroma. Hints of dried fruits mingle with a touch of oak, setting the stage for the first sip.

## Flavor Notes

Upon tasting, the Edradour 10 Year Old doesn't disappoint. The palate is a harmonious blend of sweet and spicy. Notes of creamy toffee and rich honey are balanced by a subtle spice that lingers on the tongue. There's a whisper of nuttiness there, perhaps almonds or hazelnuts, and an undercurrent of sherry from the casks in which it matured.

The finish is medium-length, leaving you with a satisfying warmth and a gentle reminder of that sherry influence. It's not overly complex, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.

## Value for Money

At around £44, Edradour 10 Year Old sits comfortably in the mid-range price bracket for single malts. Considering its age and the care that goes into small-scale production, it's fair to say that this whisky offers good value for money. It's an accessible dram, suitable for both newcomers to the whisky world and seasoned drinkers looking for a reliable staple.

## Comparable Whiskies

For those interested in exploring similar profiles, whiskies like Glenmorangie 10 Year Old or Aberfeldy 12 Year Old share a comparable sweetness and approachability, though each with their own unique twists.

## The Distillery and Brand

Edradour is known for doing things the old-fashioned way, with a hands-on approach to whisky-making. This 10 Year Old carries the essence of the brand's heritage and the unmistakable charm of a whisky crafted in small batches.

## Summary

The Edradour 10 Year Old is a solid, enjoyable whisky. It doesn't challenge the palate with intense complexity, but what it does, it does well. It's a warm, friendly dram that invites you to sit back, relax, and savor the simpler things in life.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

A solid and enjoyable dram that reflects its heritage and craftsmanship, offering a fine balance between quality and affordability. It's a whisky that doesn't ask too much of you, but gives plenty in return—a comfortable and reassuring choice for any whisky lover's shelf.
