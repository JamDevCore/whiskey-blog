        # Rosebank 1991 (bottled 2008) - Connoisseurs Choice (Gordon & MacPhail) Review

**ABV**: 43%  
**Price**: £499

Rosebank, a name whispered with reverence in whisky circles, has an allure that's hard to ignore. The Rosebank distillery, now silent, once crafted what many still consider to be the quintessential Lowland whisky. Today, we're taking a look at a special expression from this lost distillery: the Rosebank 1991, bottled in 2008 by Gordon & MacPhail for their Connoisseurs Choice range.

### First Impressions

The packaging is unassuming yet classic, the bottle shape familiar to fans of Gordon & MacPhail releases. Cradling the bottle, one gets a sense of history, a tangible link to a bygone era of Scotch whisky production.

### On the Nose

The first nosing is a delightful bouquet of florals and citrus. Rosebank's characteristic aroma of cut grass and fresh blooms comes through, with a zesty lemon twist. There's an underlying sweetness, reminiscent of honey and vanilla, suggesting a gentle maturation that hasn't overpowered the spirit's natural charm.

### The Palate

Taking the first sip, the 43% ABV delivers a gentle warmth rather than a fierce burn. The flavor profile is quintessentially Rosebank - light, with a balletic interplay of summer fruits, lemon peel, and a hint of almond. The oak influence is there, but it's like a soft whisper, adding complexity without overshadowing the spirit's youthfulness.

### Value for Money

At £499, this bottle is certainly an investment. It's not your everyday dram, but rather a collector's piece or a special occasion whisky. Given the distillery's closure and the rarity of its releases, the price is somewhat justified. For those who value whisky history and the chance to taste something from a lost distillery, it may be worth the splurge.

### Similar Whiskies

Comparing this to other whiskies is tough, given Rosebank's unique profile and rarity. However, aficionados might find similarities in other light, floral Lowland whiskies like Glenkinchie, or perhaps the elegance found in a well-aged Auchentoshan.

### The Brand and Its Legacy

Rosebank Distillery, once situated on the banks of the Forth and Clyde Canal in Falkirk, was often lauded as the "King of the Lowlands." Its closure in 1993 was a sad chapter in Scotch whisky history. Gordon & MacPhail, with their Connoisseurs Choice range, have become custodians of these rare stocks, allowing us to experience what once was.

### Final Thoughts

The Rosebank 1991 is a delicate time capsule. It's a chance to sip on history, to reflect on the fragility and the enduring legacy of Scotland's distilleries. It's not just about the liquid in the glass, but the stories, the craft, and the tradition it represents.

### Rating: 4.5/5

**Summary**: The Rosebank 1991 is a superb dram, offering a window into the soul of a lost distillery. It's light, floral, and sophisticated, with enough complexity to keep you coming back for more. While the price is steep, the opportunity to taste such a rare piece of whisky heritage offers its own form of value. This is a bottle for the true enthusiasts, those who treasure the lore and legend of Scotch whisky as much as the liquid itself.
