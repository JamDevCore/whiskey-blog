        # Glen Moray 16 Year Old Whisky Review

**Price:** £39.34  
**ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

Glen Moray, a name that resonates with whispers of the Speyside region from where it hails, has graced us with the 16 Year Old variant of their classic Scotch whisky. The first thing you'll notice is the bottle, which carries an air of understated elegance, much like the distillery itself. It's a brand that often flies under the radar, but those in the know will nod appreciatively at the sight of it.

## Flavour Journey

Pouring a dram, you're immediately greeted with a golden hue that promises a depth of character. On the nose, a gentle wave of sweet fruits and floral notes beckon, with perhaps a hint of oak lingering in the background—a classic Speyside signature.

Taking your first sip, the balance of flavors is what strikes you. There's a honeyed sweetness, not cloying, but inviting, that melds seamlessly with a touch of vanilla and a whisper of spice. It's a smooth ride from start to finish, with just enough complexity to keep things interesting. The finish is medium, leaving you with a warm, slightly nutty aftertaste and a longing for the next sip.

## Value for Money

At just under £40, the Glen Moray 16 Year Old presents itself as a superb value proposition. It's a matured whisky that doesn't demand a premium price, making it accessible for those looking to explore aged expressions without breaking the bank.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of Glen Moray's approachable style, you might also enjoy whiskies like the Glenfiddich 15 Year Old or the Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old. These Speyside siblings share a similar fruit-forward profile with that touch of oak and vanilla.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

Glen Moray has been distilling since the late 19th century, and their experience shines through in their craftsmanship. Nestled on the banks of the River Lossie, the distillery has a history of producing approachable, high-quality whiskies that often serve as an entry point for those new to Scotch.

## Conclusion and Rating

The Glen Moray 16 Year Old is a testament to the distillery's commitment to quality and tradition. It's an unpretentious whisky that offers a satisfying complexity, perfect for both the whisky newcomer and the seasoned enthusiast. With its friendly price tag and pleasing profile, it's a bottle that deserves a spot on your shelf. Whether you're unwinding after a long day or sharing a dram with friends, this whisky is sure to be a congenial companion.
