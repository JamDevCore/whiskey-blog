        # Longrow 14 Year Old - Early 2000s Review

**Brand:** Springbank  
**ABV:** 46%  
**Price:** £399

Whisky enthusiasts often look for that special dram that tells a story not just of its flavors but also of its heritage and craftsmanship. The Longrow 14 Year Old from the early 2000s is one such whisky that promises a narrative in every sip. With its moderate ABV of 46% and a price tag that will make your wallet do a double-take, this whisky positions itself as a premium offering. Let's dive into the heart of this spirit.

### First Impressions

Upon first glance, the bottle exudes an old-school charm that's reminiscent of a time when things were simpler. The label is understated, yet classy—a nod to the traditional methods still employed by the Springbank distillery. Cracking open the bottle, you're greeted with a whiff of peat, but not the kind that overpowers; it's more like a whisper of smoke on a crisp, autumn morning.

### The Flavour Journey

As you take your first sip, the complexity of the Longrow 14 unfolds. The peat is there, but it dances harmoniously with notes of ripe fruits, a hint of sea salt, and a touch of oak. It's a full-bodied whisky, one that demands your attention without shouting for it. The finish is long and warming, with a slight spiciness that lingers on the palate, inviting you to take another sip.

### Value for Money

Now, let's talk turkey. At £399, is this dram good value for money? It's a steep price, but for a discontinued expression from the early 2000s, you're paying for more than just the whisky; you're investing in a piece of history. For the serious collector or the whisky aficionado looking to commemorate a special occasion, it could be worth the splurge.

### Similar Whiskies

If you're keen on exploring similar profiles but aren't ready to part with nearly four hundred bucks, consider looking into other Springbank offerings like the Springbank 15 Year Old or the peated Kilkerran from Glengyle distillery, which shares ownership with Springbank. These alternatives offer a glimpse into the craftsmanship at a more accessible price point.

### The Story Behind the Spirit

Springbank is known for its traditional approach to whisky making, and Longrow is their peated line, a throwback to the days when all Campbeltown whiskies were peaty. The distillery is one of the few that still performs floor malting, and they oversee the entire process from malting to bottling on-site. This attention to detail and commitment to tradition is palpable in every drop of Longrow.

### Approachability

Whether you're a seasoned whisky drinker or a curious newbie, the Longrow 14 is approachable enough to be appreciated by all. Its balance of smoke and sweetness makes it an excellent choice for those looking to dip their toes into the world of peated whiskies without getting overwhelmed.

### Rating: 4/5

The Longrow 14 Year Old from the early 2000s is a whisky that commands respect. Its intricate balance of peat, fruit, and spice is a testament to the craftsmanship of Springbank. While the price is on the higher end, the experience it offers is exceptional. It's not the everyday dram but rather a contemplative sipper for those moments when you want to savor something truly special.

**Summary:** Longrow 14 Year Old is a beautifully crafted whisky that offers a harmonious blend of peat, fruit, and spice. While the price is steep, it's a worthwhile indulgence for those who appreciate the art of whisky making and the legacy of Campbeltown malts. It's a solid 4 out of 5, losing a point only because of the price point which might not be accessible to all.
