Stepping into the world of Springbank's Longrow 10 Year Old 100 Proof feels like a journey back in time to the early 2000s. This whisky, a robust and peaty offering from the renowned Campbeltown distillery, presents a bold statement in a glass.

## First Impressions

The Longrow 10 greets you with an assertive presence, the kind of whisky that doesn't shy away from making a statement. Its higher ABV is immediately indicative of a more intense experience. The bottle design, reminiscent of the era, speaks to the traditional values of Springbank.

## Flavour Profile

Upon the first sip, you're met with a wave of rich peat smoke, characteristic of Longrow's style. The peat is balanced with a sweet undertone, likely from the malt, which carries hints of dark fruit and a touch of brine - a nod to its coastal heritage. As the whisky dances on the palate, notes of leather, vanilla, and a subtle oakiness from its decade in barrels come through, culminating in a complex and warming finish.

## Value for Money

With a price tag of $399, Longrow 10 Year Old 100 Proof is certainly on the pricier side. However, considering its rarity and the weight of the Springbank name, enthusiasts might find the cost justifiable. It's a whisky that demands attention, both in flavor and in the context of its collectibility.

## Comparable Whiskies

For those looking for similar profiles, other peated expressions from regions like Islay - perhaps a Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength or an Ardbeg Uigeadail - might satisfy the craving for smoke and intensity at a lower price point. However, the unique Campbeltown character of Longrow sets it apart.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

Springbank is one of the few remaining family-owned distilleries, with a history steeped in tradition and a commitment to quality. Longrow, a line known for its peated whiskies, is a testament to Springbank's versatility and dedication to preserving the diverse Scotch whisky heritage.

## Final Thoughts

The Longrow 10 Year Old 100 Proof is a whisky that commands respect. Its intense flavor profile and high ABV are not for the faint of heart, but for those seeking a bold, peated dram, it delivers in spades. It's a snapshot of early 2000s whisky craftsmanship, and a bottle that tells the story of a region and a distillery with a rich legacy.

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

A remarkable dram with a price reflecting its rarity and provenance, Longrow 10 Year Old 100 Proof is a treat for the peat enthusiast and a worthy indulgence for those who appreciate the art of whisky-making from an earlier time.
