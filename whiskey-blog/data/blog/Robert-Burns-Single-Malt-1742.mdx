        # Robert Burns Single Malt by Arran - Whisky Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £33.27

The world of whisky is rich with history and character, much like the famous Scottish poet, Robert Burns, for whom this particular single malt is named. The Arran Distillery pays homage to Burns with this accessible and inviting whisky, offering a sip of Scotland's heritage without breaking the bank.

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the bottle and packaging of the Robert Burns Single Malt are unassuming yet elegant, much like the humble beginnings of the poet himself. The liquid inside the bottle holds a golden hue that promises a classic Scotch experience.

## The Flavour Journey

The nose of this whisky greets you with a bouquet of fresh apples, a hint of honey, and a whisper of vanilla. It's the kind of aroma that invites you in without overwhelming your senses – a delicate balance that Arran seems to have mastered.

Taking the first sip, the palate is met with a delightful blend of fruity and floral notes. There's a lightness here, reminiscent of summer orchards, paired with a subtle oakiness that speaks to its time spent maturing in casks. It's not an overcomplicated flavour profile, but it carries a certain depth that keeps you coming back for more.

The finish is smooth and warm, with a touch of spice that lingers just long enough to entice you into another sip. It's a comforting end to a rather pleasant dram.

## Value for Money

At a little over 30 bucks, the Robert Burns Single Malt positions itself as an excellent entry-level single malt Scotch. It's a bottle that won't intimidate newcomers but will still offer enough character to satisfy the seasoned whisky drinker on a casual evening.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're familiar with the likes of Glenfiddich 12 or Glenlivet 12, you'll find the Robert Burns Single Malt playing in a similar field. It's not as complex as some higher-end single malts, but it's certainly a competitor within its price range.

## The Distillery and the Poet

The Arran Distillery, located on the Isle of Arran, is a relatively young distillery with a spirit of independence that aligns well with the rebellious nature of Robert Burns himself. This whisky is not only a tribute to Scotland's national poet but also a testament to the distillery's commitment to producing quality spirits.

## Rating: 4 out of 5

The Robert Burns Single Malt by Arran is an enjoyable, easy-drinking Scotch that offers good value for money. It's not the most complex dram you'll encounter, but its charm lies in its simplicity and approachability. For those looking to explore the world of single malts without diving into the deep end, this whisky is a commendable starting point.

**Summary:** This whisky is a fitting tribute to Robert Burns, capturing the essence of both the poet and his beloved Scotland. It provides a straightforward, pleasant experience that's perfect for both whisky novices and those looking for a reliable everyday dram. With its fair price and amiable character, the Robert Burns Single Malt earns a solid 4 out of 5. Cheers to the Bard of Ayrshire!
