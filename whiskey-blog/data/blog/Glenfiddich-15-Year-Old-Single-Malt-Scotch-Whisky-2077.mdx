The first sip confirms your olfactory suspicions – it's a harmonious blend of sweet and spicy. The rich malty character is balanced by a fruity sweetness, akin to baked apples and raisins, with a subtle cinnamon twist.

The palate is smooth – no harsh burn here, just a gentle warmth that lingers pleasantly. The finish? A satisfying, spicy note that rounds off the experience with a nod to its maturation process.
