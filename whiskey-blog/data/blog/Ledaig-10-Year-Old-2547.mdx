        # Ledaig 10 Year Old Review

Ledaig 10 Year Old is a curious malt that hails from Tobermory Distillery, nestled on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. This peated expression offers a different side to the distillery's usually unpeated Tobermory brand. With an ABV of 46.3%, it sits comfortably above the standard strength, which should promise a more robust flavor profile. Priced at around Â£45.77, it's positioned as a mid-range single malt Scotch.

## First Impressions
Upon opening the bottle, Ledaig 10 greets you with a bold statement of smoky peat, a stark contrast to its Tobermory cousin. The packaging is straightforward, reflecting the no-nonsense approach of the whisky inside.

## Flavor Journey
The first sip introduces you to a complex dance of flavors. The peat is unmistakable, yet it's not as overwhelming as some of its Islay counterparts. There's a briny, maritime quality to it, reminiscent of a stormy day at sea. As you delve deeper, you'll uncover layers of fruitiness, a hint of citrus, and a touch of sweet toffee that balances the earthy smoke.

The mouthfeel is rich and oily, coating the palate and setting the stage for a long, warming finish. The peat lingers, but it's joined by a surprising note of spice and a slight nuttiness, leaving you with a satisfying conclusion to the dram.

## Value for Money
At just under $50, Ledaig 10 Year Old presents good value for money, especially for those looking to explore peated whiskies without breaking the bank. It's complex enough to intrigue seasoned drinkers but not so intense as to scare off the peat-curious.

## Comparisons and Brand Info
For those familiar with peated expressions, Ledaig 10 might be seen as a bridge between the smoky whiskies of Islay, like Ardbeg 10, and the more subdued Highland peats, such as Ardmore. Tobermory Distillery, which produces Ledaig, is known for its dual personality, crafting both peated and unpeated malts, which is somewhat unique in the Scotch whisky world.

## Final Thoughts
Ledaig 10 Year Old is a well-crafted, peated single malt that offers a delightful balance of smoke, sweetness, and maritime notes. It's a testament to Tobermory's versatility and skill in whisky making. Approachable for newcomers and engaging for aficionados, it's a dram that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.

### Rating: 4/5

**Summary:** Ledaig 10 Year Old is a robust, peated whisky that delivers depth and complexity at a fair price. Its unique character makes it a worthy addition to any whisky collection, and it earns a solid 4 out of 5 for its harmonious blend of smoke, sweetness, and sea-spray notes. Whether you're a peat lover or just peat-curious, this dram is certainly worth a pour.
