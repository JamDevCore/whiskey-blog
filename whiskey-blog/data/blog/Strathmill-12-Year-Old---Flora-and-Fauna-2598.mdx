        # Strathmill 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**Whisky Name:** Strathmill 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna  
**Brand:** Strathmill  
**Price:** Â£60.54  
**ABV:** 43%

## First Impressions
Upon first glance, the Strathmill 12 Year Old - part of the Flora and Fauna series - presents itself with a traditional yet unassuming demeanor. The label is a nod to the wildlife surrounding the distillery, which adds a personal touch to the presentation. The whisky pours a pleasing golden hue, suggesting a classic Speyside character.

## Flavor Thoughts
The nose is gentle and inviting, with hints of cut grass, vanilla, and a light floral bouquet, reminiscent of a spring day in the Scottish countryside. On the palate, it's smooth and mellow, with a sweet malty backbone complemented by notes of ripe fruit and a hint of nuttiness. The finish is medium in length, with a lingering sweetness and a subtle oakiness that ties the experience together nicely.

## Value for Money
At a little over 60 bucks, the Strathmill 12 Year Old sits in a competitive price bracket. It's not the cheapest 12-year-old you'll find, but it offers a unique flavor profile that could justify the extra spend for those looking for something a bit different from the more mainstream offerings. It's a solid, well-rounded dram that doesn't break the bank.

## Comparable Whiskies
If you enjoy the Strathmill 12, you might also appreciate whiskies like the Glenlivet 12 or the Balvenie DoubleWood 12. These are also Speyside malts that share a similar balance of sweetness and complexity, though each has its own distinct character.

## The Distillery and Brand
Strathmill, once a mill, was converted into a distillery at the end of the 19th century, and it's one of the lesser-known gems in the Diageo portfolio. The Flora and Fauna series, which this bottle is part of, was created to showcase the diversity of the distilleries owned by Diageo that don't often bottle under their own label. It gives whisky lovers a chance to explore hidden treasures like this one.

## Final Thoughts
The Strathmill 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a delightful Speyside single malt that brings a touch of the pastoral to your glass. It's a whisky that doesn't shout but rather whispers its quality, offering a refined and understated drinking experience that's both enjoyable and intriguing.

## Rating: 3.5/5
**Summary:** A solid and enjoyable Speyside single malt, the Strathmill 12 Year Old offers a unique flavor profile that stands out in its price range. It's not the boldest or the most complex whisky out there, but it's a dependable and pleasant dram that's worth a try for those looking to explore beyond the more common labels.
