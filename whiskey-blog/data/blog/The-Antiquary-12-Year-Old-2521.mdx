        # The Antiquary 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £30.94

The Antiquary 12 Year Old is a blend that might not make headlines, but it's a dram that definitely deserves a moment in the spotlight. With its classic bottle design and an age statement that promises a decent amount of maturity, this whisky enters the ring with a quiet confidence.

### First Impressions

The packaging of The Antiquary 12 Year Old is somewhat old-fashioned, with a flair that harkens back to a different era of whisky drinking. The bottle's unique shape feels good in the hand, and the label's design is simple yet elegant.

### Flavor and Experience

Upon pouring, the light amber liquid suggests a gentle approach. The nose is a blend of sweet and fruity notes, with a hint of something floral in the background. It's inviting without being overpowering.

The first sip is smooth, with a sweetness that's balanced by a touch of oak. There's a pleasant mix of vanilla, a little citrus zest, and a whisper of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. It's not a flavor bomb, but it's certainly not bland either. The finish is medium-long, with a slight warmth that fades into a mellow aftertaste.

### Value for Money

At just over £30, The Antiquary 12 Year Old is a bottle that offers good value for money. It's a solid choice for an everyday sipper, and it's versatile enough to be enjoyed neat, with a splash of water, or as the base of a cocktail.

### Similar Whiskies

If you're fond of blends like Johnnie Walker Black Label or Chivas Regal 12, The Antiquary 12 Year Old might be right up your alley. It shares that same approachable character, making it a good alternative for those looking to explore beyond the big-name brands.

### The Brand and Its Heritage

The Antiquary brand has a history dating back to the 19th century, and it's named after a novel by Sir Walter Scott. The blend itself is crafted with an array of malt and grain whiskies, which come together to create its harmonious profile. It's a nod to traditional blending methods and a testament to the skill of the blenders.

### Overall Impression

This whisky doesn't scream for attention, but it's a reliable companion for those quiet evenings when you want something uncomplicated yet satisfying. It's the kind of dram that reminds you that sometimes, simplicity and a bit of tradition are all you need.

### Rating: 3.5/5

**Summary:** The Antiquary 12 Year Old is a blended Scotch whisky that offers a smooth and enjoyable drinking experience without breaking the bank. It's not the most complex whisky out there, but its balance and pleasant flavors make it a solid choice for both newcomers and seasoned drinkers looking for an unassuming sipper.
