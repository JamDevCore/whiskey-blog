        # Highland Malt Stag Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £218.57

Whisky enthusiasts and casual sippers alike, gather round. Today, we're diving into the world of Highland Malt with their offering, the Highland Malt Stag. At first glance, the price tag might make you do a double-take. Is it worth the investment? Let's find out.

## First Impressions
Upon uncorking the bottle, you're greeted with a subtle yet inviting aroma. The Highland Malt Stag doesn't shout from the rooftops, but rather, it beckons you closer with a whisper of heather and a hint of oak. The packaging, featuring a majestic stag, certainly adds to the allure, promising a whisky that's as noble as the creature itself.

## Flavour Notes
Taking the first sip, the 40% ABV delivers a gentle warmth, not an overpowering burn. There's a sweetness here, reminiscent of honey drizzled over ripe orchard fruits, but it's balanced by a nuttiness that adds depth. A whisper of smoke lingers in the background, a nod to the traditional peat fires of Scotland. The finish is medium, leaving behind a pleasant spiciness and the memory of malt.

## Value for Money
Now, let's talk turkey—or in this case, stag. At just over $200, the Highland Malt Stag is not your everyday dram. It's positioned in a place where expectations are high, and wallets feel lighter. However, for those special occasions or as a gift to a whisky lover, it holds its own. It's not the most complex malt on the market, but it delivers a solid, enjoyable experience.

## Similar Whiskies
If you're looking for alternatives, you might consider something like Glenfiddich 18 or perhaps the Dalmore 15. Both offer that signature Highland charm, with their own unique twists, and fall into a similar price bracket.

## The Brand and Its Story
Highland Malt is not the most boisterous brand on the shelf, but they have a reputation for quality. They draw from the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highlands, and the Stag is a testament to their craft. It's a whisky that doesn't rely on age statements or gimmicks; it's straightforward and sincere.

## Overall Rating: 3.5/5

**Summary:** The Highland Malt Stag is a solid, well-crafted whisky. It might not set the world on fire with innovation, but it's a dependable choice that delivers on flavor and smoothness. The price is steep, and while it may not be an everyday sipper, it's a worthy contender for those looking to treat themselves or someone else. A solid 3.5 out of 5, the Highland Malt Stag stands proud, much like its namesake, as a noble addition to any whisky collection.
