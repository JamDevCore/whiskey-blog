        # Cutty Sark 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Brand**: Cutty Sark  
**Age**: 12 Years Old  
**ABV**: 40%  
**Price**: $29.94

Cutty Sark, a brand steeped in maritime history, named after the famous British clipper ship, offers an accessible entry into the world of aged whiskies with its 12 Year Old expression. With a modest price tag under $30, it positions itself as a potential staple for those looking to explore beyond the no-age-statement offerings without breaking the bank.

## First Impressions

The bottle design is simple yet elegant, harkening back to the brand's nautical roots. Upon pouring, you're greeted with a golden amber liquid that promises a classic whisky experience. The aroma is inviting, with hints of vanilla, citrus, and a whisper of oak that beckon you to take the first sip.

## Flavour Notes

The palate is pleasantly uncomplicated. There's a sweetness reminiscent of toffee and ripe fruits, balanced by a subtle spiciness that keeps things interesting. The oak influence is apparent but not overpowering, giving way to a light floral note that might surprise you. It's a smooth ride from start to finish, with a moderate finish that leaves a warm, slightly nutty aftertaste.

## Value for Money

At this price point, the Cutty Sark 12 Year Old is a solid purchase. It may not be the most complex whisky you'll ever taste, but it delivers a satisfying experience that outpaces many in its category. It's a versatile whisky, suitable for sipping neat, on the rocks, or even in a cocktail if you're feeling adventurous.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of other entry-level aged whiskies like Glenfiddich 12 or Chivas Regal 12, Cutty Sark 12 Year Old will feel like familiar territory. It doesn't quite have the depth of some of its Speyside counterparts, but it holds its own as a reliable, everyday dram.

## Brand and Heritage

Cutty Sark has been around since 1923, and while it may not have the cult following of some other brands, it has a loyal base of drinkers who appreciate its consistent quality and affordability. The 12 Year Old is a testament to the brand's commitment to providing age-statement whiskies that don't require a splurge.

## Overall Experience

For both newcomers and seasoned whisky drinkers, the Cutty Sark 12 Year Old is a testament to the idea that age and enjoyment don't have to come with a hefty price tag. It's a whisky that doesn't demand too much from the drinker, making it a great choice for casual evenings or as an introduction to aged Scotch.

## Rating

**3.5 out of 5**

The Cutty Sark 12 Year Old is a comfortable, no-frills whisky that offers good value for money. It's not going to redefine your whisky experience, but it's a solid, dependable choice that's easy to appreciate.
