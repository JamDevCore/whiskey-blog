        # Hankey Bannister Blended Scotch Whisky Review

**Brand:** Inver House  
**Price:** £20.74  
**ABV:** 40%

Stepping into the world of blended Scotch whiskies, Hankey Bannister presents an intriguing option for those looking to explore without breaking the bank. At a modest price of just over 20 bucks, this whisky from Inver House has a history that goes back to the 1750s, boasting a clientele that once included the likes of Winston Churchill.

## First Impressions

On the nose, Hankey Bannister is quite approachable. There's a whiff of sweet grain, a touch of vanilla, and a hint of fruitiness that doesn't overwhelm but invites you in for a closer acquaintance. The presentation is simple, nothing flashy, suggesting that the liquid inside is what truly matters.

## Flavour Experience

As we dive into the palate, the whisky doesn't disappoint. It's smooth, with a harmony of flavors that are well-balanced for a blend at this price point. The grain and malt seem to dance together, with a slight sweetness reminiscent of honey or butterscotch. There's a subtle smokiness, just enough to give it character without overpowering the gentler notes. The finish is medium, leaving a pleasant warmth that lingers just long enough to make you consider another sip.

## Value for Money

When discussing value, Hankey Bannister is a strong contender in the budget-friendly category. It's not going to compete with your single malts or high-end blends, but it's not trying to. For less than £25, it's a solid choice for everyday sipping, a casual get-together, or even as a base for whisky cocktails.

## Comparisons and Brand Info

In comparison to other whiskies in its price range, such as the Famous Grouse or Teacher's Highland Cream, Hankey Bannister holds its own with a unique profile that's both accessible and satisfying. Inver House isn't as widely recognized as some of the larger whisky houses, but they've been quietly producing quality spirits that deserve recognition.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, Hankey Bannister is a blended Scotch that offers a pleasant drinking experience without any pretense. It's a testament to the fact that you don't need to spend a fortune to enjoy a decent dram.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

In summary, Hankey Bannister is a reliable, no-frills blended Scotch that's perfect for casual whisky drinkers and those looking to dip their toes into the world of Scotch without diving in wallet-first. It's smooth, has a nice balance of flavors, and is an undeniably good value for money. While it won't knock the socks off seasoned connoisseurs, it's a solid choice for its price and a good introduction to the category.
