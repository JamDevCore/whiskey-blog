        # Rosebank 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £699

Welcome, whisky lovers and curious newcomers alike! Today we're diving into a rather special dram: the Rosebank 12 Year Old from the Flora and Fauna series. This is a bottle that has raised eyebrows and piqued interests, not just for its flavor profile but also for its place in Scotch whisky history.

## First Impressions
Upon first glance, the Rosebank 12 Year Old exudes a certain elegance. The packaging is reflective of the distillery's connection to nature, which is a nice touch considering the Flora and Fauna label. Popping the cork, you're greeted with a light, floral aroma that is quite inviting. It's like a gentle whisper, asking you to take a seat and enjoy the moment.

## The Flavor Journey
On the palate, this whisky doesn't disappoint. The 43% ABV offers a smooth experience without overwhelming the senses. It starts with a fresh, grassy note, followed by a symphony of citrus and a hint of green apple. There's a delicate sweetness there, reminiscent of honey and vanilla, which balances beautifully with a subtle spiciness.

The finish is where the Rosebank truly shines – it's long, warming, and leaves a pleasant, slightly peppery aftertaste that invites another sip. It's a whisky that manages to be both complex and approachable, a tough balance to strike.

## Value for Money
Now, the price tag of $699 is where we might lose a few folks. It's steep, and while the Rosebank 12 Year Old is undoubtedly a fine whisky, whether it's good value for money depends on the drinker. For a collector or someone who appreciates the rarity of a closed distillery's offering, it might be worth every penny. For the casual drinker, there are other whiskies with similar profiles that won't require such an investment.

## Similar Whiskies
If you're looking for a similar experience without the hefty price, consider trying something like the Glenkinchie 12 Year Old. It's also a Lowland whisky with a light, floral character, and it's much more accessible in terms of price.

## The Brand and Its Legacy
Rosebank Distillery has a storied past, being one of the few Lowland distilleries and known for its triple distillation process, which is more common in Irish whiskey. The distillery fell silent in 1993, making any bottle from Rosebank a piece of whisky history. The Flora and Fauna series itself is a nod to the diversity of Scotch whisky, showcasing different distilleries and their unique profiles.

## Summary
The Rosebank 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna is a whisky that offers a delightful and refined experience. It's not just about the taste; it's about the story behind each sip. It's a piece of whisky heritage that speaks of a time and a place that no longer exists.

**Rating:** 4/5

While the price may be a barrier for some, the Rosebank 12 Year Old is a superb example of Lowland Scotch whisky. Its gentle yet intricate flavors and the distillery's historical significance make this a highly desirable bottle for enthusiasts and collectors. For the everyday whisky drinker, it's a splurge that might be better saved for a special occasion.
