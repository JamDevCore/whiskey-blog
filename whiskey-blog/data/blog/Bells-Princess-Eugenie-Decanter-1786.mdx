        # Bell's Princess Eugenie Decanter Whisky Review

**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £59.95

Whisky collecting can sometimes be as much about the experience and the story as it is about the spirit itself. Bell's Princess Eugenie Decanter is a fine example of a whisky that offers a bit of both. This bottle celebrates a royal moment and is a part of Bell's series of decanters commemorating various significant events of the British royal family.

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the decanter is a nod to tradition and craftsmanship. It's an eye-catching piece that could serve as a conversation starter or a centerpiece in a collection. The price point of £59.95 might raise an eyebrow for some, considering it's more of a collector's item than an everyday dram, but let's delve into the liquid itself to see if the contents match the presentation.

## Flavour Profile

As you pour the whisky, you're greeted with a gentle, inviting aroma. Bell's blend is known for its accessibility and this one is no different. On the nose, there's a hint of fruitiness, a touch of oak, and a whisper of smoke – it's quite the welcoming committee.

Taking a sip, the first thing you'll notice is the smoothness. The 43% ABV is perfectly pitched to carry the flavors without overwhelming the palate. There's a pleasant sweetness reminiscent of toffee and vanilla, which is balanced by a subtle spiciness likely from the influence of oak aging. The finish is moderately long, leaving a warm trace of malt and a slight nuttiness.

## Value for Money

When it comes to value, the Bell's Princess Eugenie Decanter sits in a unique position. As a whisky, it's a solid, enjoyable blend that's smooth and easy to drink. For collectors, the decanter adds extra worth. However, if you're looking for complexity or a challenging flavor profile, you might find this blend a bit too straightforward for the price.

## Comparable Whiskies

Bell's Original, the brand's flagship blend, offers a similar taste experience and is more wallet-friendly. For those seeking a step up in complexity from the same family, consider Johnnie Walker Black Label for its pronounced smokiness and depth.

## The Brand and Its Legacy

Bell's is a brand steeped in history, with its roots dating back to the 19th century. Known for producing accessible and reliable blends, it has become a staple in many homes. The Princess Eugenie Decanter is part of a larger tradition for Bell's, which has released decanters for various royal milestones, making them collectible items beyond the whisky world.

## Final Thoughts

The Bell's Princess Eugenie Decanter is a smooth, approachable whisky with an appealing flavor profile that doesn't challenge the drinker too much. It's more of a crowd-pleaser than a critic's choice. Whether it's good value for money depends on what you're seeking – a pleasant blend or a collectible item.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Summary:** The Bell's Princess Eugenie Decanter offers an easy-drinking experience with a touch of royal flair. It's a solid choice for casual sipping and would make a nice gift for someone who appreciates whisky or has an interest in royal memorabilia. However, for seasoned whisky enthusiasts looking for depth and complexity, this may not be the most exciting choice at the price point.
