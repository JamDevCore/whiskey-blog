        # Dalmore 12 Year Old Whisky Review

**Whisky Name:** Dalmore 12 Year Old  
**Brand:** Dalmore  
**Price:** £66.85  
**ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

Right out of the gate, the Dalmore 12 Year Old makes an impression with its distinctive, regal bottle and stag emblem—a nod to the brand's historic Scottish heritage. On popping the cork, you're immediately greeted with rich, warm aromas that hint at the complexity within the glass.

## Tasting Notes

Upon the first sip, the Dalmore 12 offers a symphony of flavors. There's a sweetness reminiscent of ripe oranges and a touch of chocolate that dances on the palate. As you delve deeper, the subtleties of spice and oak emerge, a testament to its maturation in American white oak ex-bourbon casks followed by a finishing period in Oloroso sherry casks.

The mouthfeel is smooth, almost velvety, making it a very approachable whisky for novices, yet complex enough to keep seasoned enthusiasts engaged. The finish is moderately long, leaving behind a pleasant warmth and a lingering taste of spices and dried fruit.

## Value for Money

At around £66.85, the Dalmore 12 Year Old sits comfortably in the mid-range price bracket. It offers a taste that could easily compete with some of its pricier counterparts. For those looking to explore the Highland style without breaking the bank, this expression provides a solid introduction.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you enjoy the Dalmore 12, you might also appreciate whiskies like Glenmorangie Lasanta, which also enjoys a sherry cask finish, or perhaps the Macallan 12 Year Old, known for its rich fruit and spice notes. Both offer similar profiles with their own unique twists.

## Brand & Distillery

The Dalmore distillery has a storied past, with a legacy dating back to 1839. Located in the Scottish Highlands, Dalmore has built a reputation for luxury and craftsmanship. They are known for their unique still shapes and commitment to exceptional cask selection, which is evident in the depth of character found in this 12-year-old expression.

## Summary

The Dalmore 12 Year Old is a Highland single malt that strikes a fine balance between accessibility and complexity. It's a versatile whisky that can be enjoyed neat, with a drop of water, or as the base for a sophisticated cocktail. With its rich flavor profile and reasonable price point, it earns a solid rating.

**Rating:** 4 out of 5  
A well-crafted, sherry-finished whisky that offers good value for money and serves as a welcoming doorway into the world of aged single malts. It's a crowd-pleaser with enough intricacy to keep you coming back for more.
