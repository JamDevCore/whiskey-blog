        # Glenfarclas 21 Year Old Review

**Brand:** Glenfarclas  
**Age:** 21 Years  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £169.90

Stepping into the world of aged Scotch whiskies often brings with it a sense of reverence and anticipation. The Glenfarclas 21 Year Old is no exception, arriving with the weight of over two decades of maturation and the pride of a family-run distillery that has been in the business since 1836.

### First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Glenfarclas 21 greets you with its deep amber color, an inviting prelude to the experience ahead. The bottle itself is classic and unpretentious, much like the distillery's approach to whisky making.

### Flavor Profile

A gentle swirl of the glass releases the initial bouquet of aromas: rich dried fruits, hints of oak, and a whisper of smoke. The first sip coats the palate with a symphony of sherry cask influences – think Christmas cake, ripe plums, and a touch of nuttiness. There's a sweetness there, balanced by a subtle spiciness and the warmth of vanilla.

The finish is long and satisfying, with a pleasant, mellow warmth that lingers, accompanied by a slight dryness from the oak. It's a finish that invites contemplation and makes you reach for just one more sip.

### Value for Money

At just under £170, the Glenfarclas 21 is positioned in a competitive spot. It's not an everyday dram for most, but when compared to other 21-year-old Scotch whiskies, it presents a compelling value proposition. You're getting a well-aged, sherry-forward whisky that doesn't break the bank as much as some of its peers.

### Comparable Whiskies

If you enjoy the Glenfarclas 21, you might also appreciate the likes of the Aberlour 18 or the Macallan 18, both of which share that quintessential Speyside character and sherry cask maturation, though they may come at a steeper price.

### The Distillery and Brand

Glenfarclas is synonymous with tradition and a steadfast commitment to quality. The distillery has remained in the hands of the Grant family for six generations, a rarity in an industry where conglomerates often rule the roost. They're known for their direct-fired stills and exclusive use of sherry casks, which contribute greatly to the distinctive profile of their whiskies.

### Summary

The Glenfarclas 21 is a splendid example of what time and careful cask selection can create. It's a whisky that doesn't rely on bells and whistles but rather on solid craftsmanship and the beauty of age. It's approachable enough for newcomers to appreciate and complex enough for aficionados to admire.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

This is a whisky that nearly hits all the right notes, offering a delectable taste of Speyside elegance and a masterclass in sherry cask maturation. It's not quite perfection, but it's as close as one can get without reaching into the stratosphere of pricing. Whether you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or expand your whisky horizon, the Glenfarclas 21 is a worthy contender for a spot in your cabinet.
