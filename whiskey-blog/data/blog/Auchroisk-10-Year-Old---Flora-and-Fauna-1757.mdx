## First Impressions

The packaging of the Flora and Fauna series has always been charming, with illustrations that evoke a natural, almost storybook quality. The Auchroisk 10 doesn't stray from this path, presenting itself in a quaint and unassuming manner. Cracking open the bottle, the whisky greets you with a warm amber hue, hinting at a cozy experience ahead.

## The Flavour Journey

On the nose, Auchroisk 10 is pleasantly fruity with a touch of floral notes â€” think ripe apples and a whisper of wildflowers. There's a sweetness there, reminiscent of honey or maybe even a bit of vanilla, which makes it quite inviting.

Taking the first sip, the fruitiness continues, but it's balanced with a nice oakiness from the decade it spent in the barrels. There's a bit of a spicy kick, but nothing overpowering; more like a gentle nudge of cinnamon and maybe a hint of nutmeg. The sweetness on the nose carries through to the palate, with a malty character that adds depth.

The finish is medium, leaving you with a satisfying warmth and a lingering sweetness that makes you want to go back for just one more sip.

## Value for Money

At just under $50, Auchroisk 10 Year Old is a solid buy. It's not the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but for a whisky of this age and quality, you're getting a good deal. It's approachable enough for newcomers to enjoy, yet has enough complexity to keep seasoned whisky drinkers interested.

The distillery is known for its clean, light spirit, which makes it a great candidate for a gentler aging process. The Flora and Fauna series has been a great way for whisky lovers to get to know distilleries like Auchroisk, which might otherwise fly under the radar.
