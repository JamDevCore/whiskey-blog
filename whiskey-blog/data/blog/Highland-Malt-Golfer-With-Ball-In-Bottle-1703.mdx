        # Highland Malt Golfer With Ball In Bottle Review

**ABV:** 40%
**Price:** £56.90

### First Impressions

Highland Malt is a name that evokes images of the rolling Scottish hills and the age-old tradition of distilling. The Golfer With Ball In Bottle is a novel presentation that immediately catches the eye, making it a potential conversation starter or a gift for a whisky aficionado who also has an affinity for golf.

### Tasting Notes

Upon uncorking the bottle, you're greeted with a subtle aroma that hints at a blend of fruitiness and the classic earthy peat that Highland whiskies are known for. Taking a sip, the first thing you'll notice is how mellow it is, likely due to the 40% ABV, which makes it quite approachable for newcomers to the whisky world.

The flavor is a gentle mix of vanilla, a touch of apple, and a whisper of smoke – nothing that overwhelms the palate but rather invites you to savor the subtleties. The finish is short to medium, leaving a pleasant warmth and a slight sweetness lingering.

### Value for Money

At just shy of £57, the Highland Malt Golfer With Ball In Bottle is in a competitive price bracket. It's not the cheapest offering out there, but the unique bottle design might justify the extra dollars for those looking for a gift or an eye-catching shelf piece. In terms of flavor, it's a solid, if not spectacular, choice that won't disappoint but might not astonish seasoned whisky drinkers.

### Comparable Whiskies

In flavor profile, it's a gentler cousin to some of the more robust Highland single malts. It could be compared with the likes of Glenmorangie Original for its approachability or perhaps even the Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old for its gentle fruit and peat notes, although both are slightly higher in ABV and complexity.

### Brand and Distillery

Highland Malt isn't one of the giants of the whisky world, but they've carved out a niche with their themed bottles. This playful approach might not win over purists, but it does offer a point of difference in a market that can sometimes take itself a bit too seriously.

### Summary

The Highland Malt Golfer With Ball In Bottle is a whisky that's as much about the presentation as it is about the contents. It's an easy sipper, not challenging but pleasantly enjoyable. Whether you're buying as a gift for a golf lover or just want a whisky that's a bit different from the rest, it's a decent choice.

**Rating:** 3/5

A middle-of-the-road whisky with a unique bottle design that might just swing it as a quirky gift. It won't set your world alight with its flavor, but it won't disappoint either.
