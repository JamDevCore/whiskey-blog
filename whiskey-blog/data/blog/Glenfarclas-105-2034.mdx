        # Glenfarclas 105 Review

**ABV:** 60%  
**Price:** £62.64

Whisky enthusiasts, gather round as we delve into the world of Glenfarclas and their powerhouse expression, the Glenfarclas 105. This cask strength beast isn't for the faint of heart, but it promises a journey through the rich traditions of Speyside whisky.

### First Impressions

The Glenfarclas 105 bottle exudes a sense of robust tradition with its no-frills label and deep amber liquid calling from within. Upon cracking open the bottle, you're greeted with a waft of strong, spirited aromas, a prelude to the experience waiting in your glass.

### The Flavour Journey

As you take your first sip, brace yourself—this is cask strength, meaning it's straight from the barrel and uncut, sitting at a bold 60% ABV. But don't let that intimidate you. A splash of water can open up the whisky, allowing its true character to shine without diluting its essence.

Upon tasting, the initial warmth evolves into a complex array of flavors. Dark fruits intermingle with hints of sherry, a nod to the sherry cask maturation Glenfarclas is renowned for. Spices tickle the palate, and there's a comforting undercurrent of oak and vanilla that rounds out the profile. The finish is long, warming, and pleasantly sweet, leaving a lingering taste of what feels like a well-deserved indulgence.

### Value for Money

At around £62.64, the Glenfarclas 105 is a testament to value for money in the world of cask strength whisky. It's a full-bodied experience that can stand toe-to-toe with other higher-priced heavyweights. For those looking to explore the upper echelons of strength without breaking the bank, this dram is a solid choice.

### Comparisons and Context

In the realm of similar whiskies, the Aberlour A'bunadh comes to mind with its also sherry-forward and cask strength profile. However, the Glenfarclas 105 holds its own with a distinctive character that's worth exploring for its unique take on the style.

### Brand Backstory

Glenfarclas, a family-run distillery since the 1800s, has a rich history of producing some of Speyside's most beloved whiskies. The 105 denotes the British proof, which equates to 60% ABV in today’s measurements. It's a nod to tradition while still making a mark in the modern whisky world.

### Overall Experience

The Glenfarclas 105 is not just a drink; it's an experience. It's a conversation starter, a contemplative sipper, and a bold statement in a glass. Approachable for newcomers (with a bit of water and patience) and respected by aficionados, it's a whisky that truly has something for everyone.

### Rating: 4.5/5

**Summary:** The Glenfarclas 105 is a robust and flavorful cask strength whisky that offers an excellent balance of quality and affordability. Its rich sherry-influenced profile and the adaptable nature of its high ABV make it a dram that can be enjoyed in various ways. It's a near-perfect representation of what a Speyside powerhouse can be.
