## First Impressions

Upon first encounter, the presentation of the BenRiach 20 Year Old suggests elegance. The bottle's silhouette is classic yet unassuming, letting the amber liquid within do the talking. Cracking open the bottle, you're greeted with a bouquet of aromas that hint at a rich, layered experience. There's a gentle sweetness, a touch of fruit, and a whisper of wood—each element beckoning you to take the first sip.

## Flavour Profile

As the whisky graces your palate, it unfolds like a well-thumbed book of stories. The initial sweetness is reminiscent of honey and ripe orchard fruits, with a subtle backdrop of vanilla. This sweetness is then complemented by a nuttiness and a wisp of smoke, not overpowering but rather perfectly integrated, adding depth to each sip.

The oak influence is evident but not domineering, imparting a warm spiciness and a hint of dried fruit that lingers on the finish. The balance achieved here is commendable—a harmonious interplay between the sweetness, fruit, and the mature oak.

## Value for Money

At just shy of £125, the BenRiach 20 Year Old sits at a price point that reflects its age and the care taken in its maturation.
