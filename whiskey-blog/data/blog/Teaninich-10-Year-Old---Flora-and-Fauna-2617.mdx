**Age:** 10 Years Old  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** Â£47.34

## First Impressions

Upon first glance, the Teaninich 10 Year Old from the Flora and Fauna series presents itself with a rather unassuming demeanor. The packaging is straightforward, with the label giving a nod to the wildlife that surrounds the Teaninich distillery. It's clear that this whisky doesn't rely on flashy presentation, but rather lets the spirit inside do the talking.

## Flavor Deep-Dive

On the nose, the Teaninich 10 offers a bouquet of fresh, green aromas. Think cut grass and a hint of apple orchards after a spring shower. There's a touch of floral notes as well, suggesting a walk through a blooming meadow.

The first sip greets the palate with a crisp, malty sweetness. There's a smooth transition into flavors of vanilla and a subtle nuttiness, balanced with a light zestiness that keeps things interesting. The finish is medium-long, with a pleasant warmth and a whisper of spice that doesn't overstay its welcome.

## Value for Money?

At just under $50, Teaninich 10 Year Old stands as a solid investment for whisky lovers. It's not the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but it delivers a refined and unique experience that justifies the price point. It's a whisky that offers enough complexity to keep seasoned sippers engaged, while remaining accessible to those new to the world of single malts.

## Comparisons and Insights

In the realm of 10-year-old single malts, Teaninich 10 Year Old holds its own against the likes of Glenmorangie Original or the Balvenie 12 Year Old DoubleWood. While those may be more widely recognized names, Teaninich offers a more grassy and herbaceous profile that sets it apart.

Teaninich, a Highland distillery, is known for its innovative approach to whisky-making, having been one of the first to introduce the hammer mill and mash filter. This process results in a clearer wort, giving the whisky its distinctive clean and crisp character.

## Final Thoughts

For those looking to explore the Flora and Fauna series or seeking a Highland single malt with a fresh and vibrant profile, Teaninich 10 Year Old is a delightful choice. It's a whisky that doesn't shout for attention but rather invites you in for a closer look, rewarding the curious with its subtle complexities and fresh flavors.
