        # Old Ballantruan 'The Peated Malt' Review

**Brand:** Tomintoul  
**Price:** £45.55  
**ABV:** 50%

Stepping into the world of peated whiskies can be like stepping onto a new continent for the palate. Old Ballantruan 'The Peated Malt' is an intriguing exploration into this smoky realm, brought to us by the Tomintoul distillery, traditionally known for their gentler Speyside character.

### First Impressions

Upon first nosing, Old Ballantruan greets you with a welcoming handshake of earthy smoke. It's not the overwhelming campfire of some Islay whiskies, but a refined, sophisticated peat that whispers of its Speyside origins. The higher alcohol content (50% ABV) carries the aroma well, without overpowering the senses.

### Flavor Profile

A sip reveals a complex character. The peat remains central but is beautifully balanced with a touch of sweetness, akin to vanilla and honey. There's a little spice that tickles the tongue, perhaps a nod to white pepper or clove. The malt's robustness is undeniable, yet it dances nimbly across the palate without the weightiness you might expect from such a peaty dram.

### Value for Money

Priced at just over $45, Old Ballantruan presents as a solid value, especially for a whisky sitting at 50% ABV. It's a compelling choice for those looking to dabble in peat without diving wallet-first into the more expensive options.

### Similar Whiskies

If you've enjoyed the likes of BenRiach Curiositas or Ardmore Traditional Cask, you'll likely find Old Ballantruan 'The Peated Malt' to be in good company. It offers a different take on peat, steering clear of the maritime influences of its island cousins.

### The Distillery and The Whisky

Tomintoul, often referred to as 'the gentle dram', showcases their versatility with Old Ballantruan. It's a testament to their craftsmanship that they can produce such a peat-forward whisky without losing the distillery's inherent smoothness. The non-age statement (NAS) approach allows the blender to select casks that best express the peated character, rather than being constrained by age.

### Final Thoughts

Old Ballantruan 'The Peated Malt' is like a novel you can't put down—engaging from the first page to the last. It's a dram that invites you into the peaty fold without demanding you pledge allegiance to the smoke.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Old Ballantruan 'The Peated Malt' is a Speyside with an unexpected twist of peat, delivering a well-rounded, flavorful experience that punches above its price point. It's a whisky that can proudly sit on the shelf of a peat lover or a Speyside aficionado alike, offering a delightful sip that's as complex as it is enjoyable.
