        # Glen Spey 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna Review

**Brand:** Glen Spey  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 43%  
**Price:** £58.63

Nestled in the heart of Speyside, Glen Spey distillery offers its 12-year-old single malt as part of the revered Flora and Fauna series. At first glance, the whisky presents itself with an understated elegance that is characteristic of the distillery's style.

### First Impressions

Upon opening the bottle, you're greeted with a bouquet of gentle floral notes, a hint of fresh grass, and a whisper of fruitiness that beckons you into the glass. The presentation is simple, no-nonsense, and the whisky's color is a pleasing natural gold that suggests a respectful aging process without excessive interference.

### Flavor Profile

On the palate, Glen Spey 12 Year Old offers a light, yet complex, array of flavors. It starts with a delicate sweetness reminiscent of honey and stewed fruits, followed by a mid-palate of nuttiness and a touch of spice. The finish is where this whisky really shines, with a satisfying length that leaves a subtle oakiness and the faintest hint of smoke.

What stands out is the balance — it’s not an intense dram that will overwhelm your senses, but rather a refined experience that invites you to savor each sip. The 43% ABV is a sweet spot, offering enough weight to carry the flavors without the need for any water to open it up.

### Value for Money

At just under £60, Glen Spey 12 Year Old is positioned in a competitive market. It doesn't scream luxury, nor does it fall into the budget category. For a 12-year-old single malt, the price is fair, especially considering the quality and complexity it delivers. It's a good introduction to the Speyside region for those looking to explore beyond the more common household names.

### Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of the lighter Speyside offerings, such as the Cragganmore 12 Year Old or the Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old, you'll find a comfortable, albeit slightly more nuanced, companion in Glen Spey 12. It doesn't boast the bold sherry influence of a Macallan or the intense fruitiness of a Glenfiddich, but it certainly holds its own with a subtlety that is both refreshing and engaging.

### The Distillery and Brand

Glen Spey is somewhat of an unsung hero in the whisky world, often overshadowed by its more prominent neighbors. However, for those in the know, it represents a distillery that focuses on craftsmanship and tradition. The Flora and Fauna series itself is a nod to the biodiversity of Scotland, adding an extra layer of charm to the whisky and appealing to those who appreciate a good backstory with their dram.

### Conclusion

Glen Spey 12 Year Old is a whisky that doesn't shout for attention but rather waits to be discovered by those seeking a quieter sophistication. It's an excellent choice for an everyday dram or for sharing with friends who appreciate a gentle, well-crafted whisky.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Summary:** Glen Spey 12 Year Old is a refined and balanced Speyside single malt that offers good value for money. It's not the boldest whisky on the shelf, but its complexity and subtlety make it a delightful sipper for both new enthusiasts and seasoned drinkers.
