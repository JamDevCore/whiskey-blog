        # Ardmore Traditional Cask Review

Welcome to a cozy corner where we chat about liquid gold, and today we're nosing, sipping, and musing over the Ardmore Traditional Cask. Let's dive into the essence of this Highland dram.

**ABV:** 46%  
**Price:** £44.95

## First Impressions

Uncorking the bottle, you're greeted with a whiff of peat - not the overpowering kind, but a gentle nudge that says, "I'm here, and I've brought friends." The Ardmore Traditional Cask, with its no age statement, presents itself in a no-frills manner, the bottle and label echoing the simplicity of its contents.

## On the Nose

Bring the glass to your nose, and the peat's smokiness is there, but it's joined by a choir of heather, honey, and a subtle fruitiness akin to baked apples. It's like a highland hike through dewy, smoky moors with a picnic basket in tow.

## On the Palate

Take a sip, and the 46% ABV delivers a warm embrace without the sting. The palate is an interesting dance between the smoky peat and the sweeter, maltier notes. There's a slight spice that teases the tongue, reminiscent of cracked black pepper, and a vanilla undertone that rounds it out. It's a whisky that doesn't shout, but rather converses with you, revealing its layers as you go.

## Value for Money

At just shy of £45, Ardmore Traditional Cask offers a peaty profile that's not common in Highland whiskies, making it a delightful oddity. It's a middle-ground malt, offering enough complexity to intrigue the seasoned sippers, while not alienating those new to the peat parade.

## Similar Whiskies

If the Ardmore Traditional tugs at your taste buds, you might find kinship with the likes of Highland Park 12 or the BenRiach Curiositas. Both offer that peat-with-sweet dynamic, though each with their own distinctive flair.

## The Brand and the Drink

The Ardmore distillery has a history of sticking to traditional methods, including the use of peat, which was once the norm before coal became the go-to. This adherence to tradition shines through in their Traditional Cask, offering a sip of history with every dram.

## Summary

The Ardmore Traditional Cask is a solid Highland contender, especially for those looking to dip their toes into peatier waters without diving headfirst into the Islay deep end. It's a whisky that could easily become a go-to for a relaxing evening by the fire or as a conversation starter at a gathering of friends.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

In summary, the Ardmore Traditional Cask is a pleasant, peaty surprise from the Highlands, balancing smoke with sweetness at a fair price point. It's not the most complex whisky you'll ever try, but it's one that's sure to leave a warm, smoky imprint on your memory, beckoning for another dram.
