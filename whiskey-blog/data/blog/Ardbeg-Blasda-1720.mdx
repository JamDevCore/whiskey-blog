        # Ardbeg Blasda Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** £299

Ardbeg, a brand synonymous with peaty Islay whiskies, once released a rather unique expression to their line-up: the Ardbeg Blasda. With an ABV sitting at a gentle 40%, it's one of the lighter offerings from a distillery known for its robust character. Now, let's uncork this bottle and delve into the world of Ardbeg's softer side.

### First Impressions

Right off the bat, Blasda challenges what you might expect from Ardbeg. The packaging retains the distillery's signature look – dark and mysterious – but inside, the liquid tells another story. Pouring it into the glass, you're greeted with a lighter shade than the usual deep golds or ambers of Ardbeg's heavier hitters.

### Flavor Profile

On the nose, Blasda is surprisingly gentle. There's a whisper of peat smoke, but it's not the bonfire you might be bracing for. Instead, there are notes of citrus, a hint of sweet vanilla, and a floral touch that might remind you of a breezy day on the Islay coast.

Taking a sip, the peat is there, but it's playing nicely with other flavors – think of it as a peat smoke veil rather than a blanket. There's a zesty lemon tang, a bit of green apple, and a touch of almond. The finish is where Ardbeg's heritage peeks through a bit more with a longer, smoky tail than the initial taste suggests, though it's still milder than many of its siblings.

### Value for Money

At £299, Blasda is certainly not an everyday dram, and its price point is a reflection of its rarity rather than its punch. It's a collector's item, a conversation starter, and perhaps a gateway for those looking to ease into the peatier end of the whisky pool without diving headfirst.

### Comparisons

If Blasda's profile intrigues you, but the price tag or availability puts it out of reach, consider exploring other lightly peated whiskies. Perhaps the Highland Park 12 Year Old, which offers a balance of sweet and smoke at a more accessible price point, or the Bowmore 12 Year Old, which also delivers a more nuanced peat experience.

### Brand and Distillery Info

Ardbeg has a storied history, crafting whiskies since 1815 on the Isle of Islay. Known for their commitment to quality and a certain flair for the dramatic in their expressions, they've garnered a passionate following. Blasda is a nod to the distillery's versatility and willingness to play with expectations.

### Summary

**Rating:** 3.5/5

Ardbeg Blasda is an intriguing oddity in the Ardbeg range. It's not the peat monster you might expect, but rather a gentle giant with a complex, lighter flavor profile. While it may not provide the same value for money as some of its peers, it's a must-try for collectors and those interested in the subtler side of smoke. Whether it's worth the investment will depend on your appreciation for rarity and brand loyalty.

In the end, Blasda is a whisky that dares to be different, and for that, it earns a commendable 3.5 out of 5. If you're seeking an Ardbeg with less growl and more grace, this might just be the dram for you.
