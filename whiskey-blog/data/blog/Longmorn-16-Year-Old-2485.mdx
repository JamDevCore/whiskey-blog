        # Longmorn 16 Year Old Whisky Review

- **Brand:** Longmorn
- **Age:** 16 Years Old
- **ABV:** 48%
- **Price:** $86.95

Longmorn is a distillery that often flies under the radar, but among whisky aficionados, it's a name that resonates with quality and complexity. The Longmorn 16 Year Old is no exception, and at 48% ABV, it's positioned to deliver a more robust experience than many standard bottlings. Let's dive into the glass and see what this Speyside single malt has to offer.

**First Impressions:**
Pouring a dram, the whisky greets you with a deep, rich amber color, hinting at the years it's spent maturing. The bottle design is elegant and understated, much like the distillery's approach to crafting their spirits.

**Flavour Profile:**
On the nose, Longmorn 16 Year Old offers a delightful mix of ripe orchard fruits, honey, and a hint of oak. It's a welcoming aroma that invites you in for a taste. The first sip reveals a beautifully balanced whisky with layers of flavor. Sweetness from the malt, vanilla, and caramel notes blend with a gentle spiciness and a touch of citrus zest. The oak influence is there, but it's well-integrated, adding depth without overpowering.

The mouthfeel is creamy, almost velvety, which is a testament to its non-chill-filtered nature. The finish is long and warming, leaving a pleasant mingling of spice and sweetness on the palate.

**Value for Money:**
At approximately $87, Longmorn 16 is not the cheapest bottle on the shelf, but it's also far from the most expensive, especially considering its age and ABV. It presents good value for a whisky of this caliber, and for a 16-year-old single malt, the price is quite reasonable.

**Comparisons:**
If you're a fan of other Speyside whiskies like the Glenfiddich 18 or the Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask, you'll find Longmorn 16 to be in good company, albeit with its unique character. It strikes a balance between the fruitiness of the former and the richness of the latter.

**Brand Background:**
Longmorn Distillery was founded in 1893 and has been known for producing whiskies that are a staple in many blended Scotch whiskies. It's only in recent years that Longmorn's single malts have begun to garner the appreciation they deserve on their own.

**Summary:**
Longmorn 16 Year Old is a sophisticated and delicious Speyside single malt that offers complexity and richness without being overwhelming. It's a whisky that can be enjoyed by both newcomers to the world of Scotch and seasoned drinkers. The balance between fruit, sweetness, and spice is exemplary, making it a versatile dram for various occasions.

**Rating:** 4.5/5

A near-perfect score for the Longmorn 16 Year Old, as it delivers an exceptional drinking experience that's well worth its price. This whisky is a shining example of what Speyside has to offer and a testament to the craftsmanship of Longmorn Distillery.
