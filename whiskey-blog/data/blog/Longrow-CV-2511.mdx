        # Longrow CV Review

**Brand:** Springbank  
**Price:** £299  
**ABV:** 46%

Longrow CV, a product of the venerable Springbank distillery, nestles itself into a unique niche in the world of whisky. Known for their traditional approach to distillation and an undeniable commitment to quality, Springbank offers Longrow CV as a peated variant that stands out in their lineup.

### First Impressions

Upon opening the bottle, the Longrow CV doesn't shy away from making a statement. The packaging is straightforward and unfussy, letting you know that the real treat lies within. Its amber glow invites you in for a closer inspection.

### The Flavour Journey

As you take the first sip, the Longrow CV greets you with a smoky embrace. The peat here isn't as aggressive as some Islay whiskies but rather plays a harmonious second fiddle to a symphony of flavors. You'll find notes of ripe fruit and a subtle sweetness that rounds out the initial earthy tones. The mid-palate brings a touch of oak and vanilla, adding complexity to this dram. The finish is long, with the smoke lingering just enough to remind you of its presence, accompanied by a slight maritime saltiness that speaks to its Campbeltown roots.

### Value for Money

At £299, Longrow CV sits in a higher price bracket, making it a consideration for special occasions rather than an everyday tipple. However, its unique character and the craftsmanship behind it might justify the expense for those who appreciate a complex, peated whisky.

### Similar Whiskies

If you're exploring whiskies in a similar vein, you might consider Talisker 18 or even the Springbank 15 as companions. Both offer that dance between smoke and sweetness, though each with their distinct personality.

### Brand and Distillery

Springbank, a family-owned distillery, is one of the few remaining that carry out the full production process on site. This includes malting their own barley, which is a rarity in today's whisky world. The Longrow CV is a testament to their dedication, showcasing a different side of Springbank's craftsmanship with its peated profile.

### Approachability

For newcomers to peated whiskies, Longrow CV could serve as a gentle introduction. It's not as intense as some, but it still offers enough of that characteristic smokiness to give a proper introduction to the style.

### Overall Rating: 3.5/5

**Summary:**  
Longrow CV is a rich, peated whisky that offers a complex flavor profile with a commendable balance between smoke and sweetness. While the price point is on the higher side, it reflects the quality and care that goes into each bottle. This whisky might not be an everyday dram for most, but it's certainly worth savoring on those special occasions. The Longrow CV earns a solid 3.5 out of 5, representing a well-crafted whisky with a unique character that's worth exploring for enthusiasts and curious newcomers alike.
