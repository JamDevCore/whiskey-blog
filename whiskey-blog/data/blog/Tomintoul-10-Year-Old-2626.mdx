        # Tomintoul 10 Year Old Whisky Review

**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** Â£35.99

Welcome to my casual corner where we talk about whisky in the most laid-back way possible. Today we're diving into the Tomintoul 10 Year Old, a Speyside single malt that promises to be as smooth as the region's reputation.

### First Impressions
The packaging is simple yet elegant, much like what you'd expect from a distillery that prides itself on 'the gentle dram'. The bottle shape is traditional, and the label gives off a classic vibe. It's not trying to be flashy, and that's refreshing.

### Tasting Notes
On the nose, Tomintoul 10 greets you with a soft bouquet of vanilla and honey. There's a hint of green apples and a whisper of almond, which makes you think of a light dessert rather than a deep, brooding dram.

Taking the first sip, the smoothness is immediately apparent. It's gentle on the palate, with flavors of malted barley and a touch of sweetness reminiscent of butterscotch. The fruitiness hinted at in the aroma comes through mid-palate, with a subtle oakiness that anchors the experience.

The finish is short to medium, leaving a pleasant warmth with a slight spiciness that doesn't overstay its welcome.

### Value for Money
At a price point of around $36, Tomintoul 10 Year Old is what I'd call a solid entry-level Speyside malt. It's not going to break the bank, and it delivers enough character to make it a worthwhile purchase for both newcomers and seasoned whisky drinkers looking for a reliable everyday dram.

### The Speyside Connection
If you're familiar with Speyside whiskies, you'll know they're often characterized by their elegance and subtlety. Tomintoul 10 fits right in with its approachable profile. It's in the same ballpark as the Glenlivet Founder's Reserve or the Glen Moray Classic, both of which are also friendly to the wallet and the palate.

### The Brand and Distillery
Tomintoul distillery sits in the heart of the Speyside region, nestled in the Glenlivet Estate. It's been around since the 1960s, a relatively young age in whisky terms, but it has established a reputation for producing smooth, easy-drinking malts. The 10 Year Old is their flagship expression, setting the standard for their range.

### Final Thoughts
Tomintoul 10 doesn't aim to be the most complex whisky on the shelf, and that's okay. It's a quintessential Speyside malt that's accessible, enjoyable, and won't leave you feeling guilty about the price. It's the kind of whisky that's perfect for a relaxed evening or introducing a friend to the world of Scotch.

**Rating:** 3.5/5

**Summary:** Tomintoul 10 Year Old is the epitome of a 'gentle dram'. It's smooth, it's approachable, and it's priced right. While it may not be the most exciting whisky out there, it's a dependable choice for a casual sipper or a Speyside starter.
