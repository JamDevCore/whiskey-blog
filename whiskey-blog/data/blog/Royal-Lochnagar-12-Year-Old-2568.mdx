**Brand:** Lochnagar  
**Age:** 12 Years  
**ABV:** 40%  
**Price:** Â£47.35  

Nestled near Balmoral Castle, Royal Lochnagar is a brand with a regal connection, and their 12 Year Old single malt scotch whisky is a testament to tradition and craftsmanship. With a modest price tag of just over $45, it piques the interest of both casual sippers and seasoned aficionados.

## First Impressions
Upon the first pour, the whisky greets you with a rich, golden hue, suggesting a promise of depth and character. The bottle design is unassuming, yet dignified, much like the distillery itself. A gentle swirl releases an inviting aroma of honeyed fruits and a whisper of wood spice, drawing you closer.

## Flavour Profile
On the palate, Royal Lochnagar 12 Year Old unfolds gracefully. It's a dance of delicate fruitiness with apples and a hint of orange zest, balanced by a malty sweetness reminiscent of freshly baked bread. The maturity of this whisky is evident in the subtle oak notes that provide a firm backbone without overpowering the spirit's inherent lightness.

The finish is where this dram truly shines. It's surprisingly long for a whisky of this ABV, leaving a satisfying warmth with a touch of vanilla and a faint smokiness that lingers just long enough to entice you back for another sip.

## Value for Money
At this price point, the Royal Lochnagar 12 Year Old stands its ground. It's not the cheapest 12-year-old on the market, but it's far from the priciest. For those seeking a gentle introduction to the world of single malts, or for the seasoned drinker looking for a reliable, everyday dram, this whisky hits the sweet spot.

## Comparable Whiskies
If you enjoy the profile of Royal Lochnagar 12, you might also appreciate the Glenfiddich 12 or the Dalwhinnie 15. Both offer a similar balance of fruit and malt, with their own unique twists.

## The Brand and Distillery
The Royal Lochnagar distillery has a storied past, with a royal warrant granted by Queen Victoria herself. It's a brand steeped in history, and this 12 Year Old expression reflects their commitment to maintaining a classic profile that has withstood the test of time.

## Conclusion
Royal Lochnagar 12 Year Old is a dignified, approachable whisky that serves as a faithful representation of the Highland style. It's a solid choice for those seeking quality without extravagance, and a delightful sipper for any occasion.

**Rating: 3.5/5**

A well-crafted, balanced single malt that offers good value for money and a taste of Scottish heritage. Not the most complex or adventurous, but certainly a reliable and enjoyable dram for those appreciative of subtlety and tradition.
