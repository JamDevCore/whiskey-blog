        # Bernheim Original Whiskey Review

Whiskey enthusiasts and casual sippers alike, gather round. Today, we're diving into the world of wheat whiskies with a look at the Bernheim Original from the Bernheim brand. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's lay out the basics:

- **ABV**: 45%
- **Price**: £61.24

## First Impressions
On first glance, Bernheim Original stands out with its sleek bottle and the promise of a wheat whiskey, which is somewhat of a rarity in a market dominated by rye and corn mash bills. Popping the cork, you're greeted with a gentle, sweet aroma that hints at the smooth experience to come.

## Flavour Deep Dive
Taking the first sip, the 45% ABV offers a warmth that doesn't overpower the more delicate wheat flavors. You might notice a harmony of vanilla and honey notes, with just a whisper of spice to keep things interesting. Bernheim Original doesn't punch you in the palate; instead, it invites you to explore its subtleties with each sip.

## Value for Money
At just over 60 bucks, Bernheim Original sits comfortably in the mid-range price bracket. It's not the cheapest whiskey on the shelf, but for what it offers—a unique wheat profile and a mellow sipping experience—it's certainly good value for money. It's a solid choice for someone looking to explore beyond the typical bourbon or rye without breaking the bank.

## Similar Whiskies
If Bernheim Original tickles your fancy, you might also enjoy other wheat whiskies like W.L. Weller or even step into the world of wheated bourbons like Maker's Mark, which share a similar sweetness and smoothness.

## Brand Backstory
Bernheim Original is the proud product of Heaven Hill Distillery, a family-owned company with a storied history in the whiskey business. What sets Bernheim apart is its claim to fame as the first new style of American Whiskey introduced since Prohibition. It's a trailblazer, much like its namesake, Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, a pioneer in the whiskey industry.

## Overall Experience
Approachable, smooth, and with enough character to keep you coming back for more, Bernheim Original is a whiskey that offers an experience as pleasant as a serene Kentucky sunset.

## Rating: 4/5

In summary, Bernheim Original is a delightful wheat whiskey with a smooth profile and a hint of sweetness. It's fairly priced for the quality and offers a nice change of pace from the corn and rye-dominated shelves. It's not perfection, but it's darn close, especially for those seeking a gentler whiskey. Bernheim Original earns a solid 4 out of 5. Cheers to a wheat whiskey well done!
