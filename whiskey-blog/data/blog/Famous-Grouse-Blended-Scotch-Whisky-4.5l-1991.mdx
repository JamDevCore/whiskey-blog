        # Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky Review

**Whisky Name:** Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky  
**Brand:** Famous Grouse  
**Price:** $129.99 (for a 4.5L bottle)  
**ABV:** 40%

## First Impressions

Upon setting eyes on the Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky, particularly in its generous 4.5-liter incarnation, one can't help but be taken aback by the sheer volume of spirit on offer. The packaging is classic and unpretentious, much like the brand itself, which prides itself on being a staple in many a household.

## Flavor Notes

Taking a sip, the whisky greets you with a smooth and welcoming embrace. There's a subtle sweetness that hints at malted barley and a touch of dried fruit, which then gives way to a soft, oaky warmth. The finish is relatively short but pleasantly mellow, with just a whisper of spice and smoke that doesn't overstay its welcome.

It's the kind of dram that doesn't demand your full attention with each sip, making it perfect for a casual evening chat or while you're lost in a good book.

## Value for Money

At just under $130 for 4.5 liters, Famous Grouse offers a fair deal, especially for those looking to keep their home bar stocked without breaking the bank. It's a reliable choice for both sipping neat and mixing into cocktails, where its balanced profile can shine without overpowering other ingredients.

## Comparable Whiskies

If you're a fan of Famous Grouse and looking for something similar, you might want to try other blends like Johnnie Walker Black Label for its smokier notes or Teacher's Highland Cream for a bit more richness and depth.
